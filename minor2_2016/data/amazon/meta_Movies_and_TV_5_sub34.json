Jeff Goldblum and Debra Winger are in the mix, too, and while no one's trying to make history with this film, it is funnier and fresher than most reviewers gave it credit for being.--Tom Keogh", "price": 24.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 485331}, "asin": "0767800761", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MC3QW0JHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Thank God It's Friday [VHS]"}
{"description": "Comic genius Steve Martin delivers an incredible performance as an engaging small town fire chief who has only one tiny flaw - no, make that one HUGE flaw - his astonishingly long nose. Although he considers it no laughing matter, the hilarity never stops as C.D. Bales (Martin) contends with jerky nose jokes, a bumbling crew of firemen, and his secret love for gorgeous astronomy student Roxanne (Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, she is attracted to fireman Chris (Rick Rossovich), who's tall on looks and short on conversation. And when C.D. agrees to coach the dumbstruck Chris in his pursuit of the fair maiden, this ticklish triangle dissolves into a hilarious series of rib-tickling romantic misadventures. A contemporary love story of mistaken identity and unrequited love, ROXANNE is an unforgettable comedy that Siskel & Ebert call a comic masterpiece.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002T51X4Q", "B003BZ58RQ", "B00005PJ6O", "B0000D1FFU", "B001HB1JZQ", "0790742071", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00287Z18Y", "B00015YVD6", "078322740X", "B00008979G", "B0028ZDJN0", "0783227353", "B000035Z3C", "6305236569", "B0000YEENU", "B00004RJ73", "B008BIE7Q6", "B002O3Z4YI", "B00386EZKE", "6304765266", "B000ZM1MG4", "B000E6ESI0", "0486411192", "B002GHHHNI", "B000087F6M", "B000EHRVOW", "0790740044", "B00DW5ILUG", "B000FBH3V8", "B00158K0QU", "B00008G7UF", "B000MRNWK6", "B0071HPOGK", "B000YDBPAM", "0822003465", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY0KW", "B0002B15X8", "B00000IQW5", "B000K7VHTQ", "6305609764", "B00005T7HZ", "078321958X", "6305133468", "B00AEFYT94", "0783225482", "B0019HQICW", "0783232063", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00005V5NS", "0792844866", "0553213601", "B001ECDVJU", "B007P9HW3M", "B001ECDVK4", "B00005QT9O", "B000FO0AA6", "0792844890", "630471193X", "0767810856", "0783229364", "B007N31YH0", "B00013WWT8", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00003CXHG", "B00AEFY0F2", "6305213283", "B00008G8LM", "B0043X1FL8", "6305162018", "B00000IQBW", "B0045HCJ76", "B004RPQSS2", "B00AEBB8NS", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000LXGXXE", "B00C6F61HS", "B002GHHHP6"], "bought_together": ["B00005PJ6O"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005PJ6O", "B00287Z18Y", "B00386EZKE", "B002T51X4Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 10947}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.48, "brand": "Generic", "asin": "0767818105", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71S23VMGT6L._SY300_.gif", "title": "Roxanne"}

{"description": "Unanimously hailed as one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of the motion picture,Seven Samuraihas inspired countless films modeled after its basic premise. But Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 action drama has never been surpassed in terms of sheer power of emotion, kinetic energy, and dynamic character development. The story is set in the 1600s, when the residents of a small Japanese village are seeking protection against repeated attacks by a band of marauding thieves. Offering mere handfuls of rice as payment, they hire seven unemployed \"ronin\" (masterless samurai), including a boastful swordsman (Toshiro Mifune) who is actually a farmer's son desperately seeking glory and acceptance. The samurai get acquainted with but remain distant from the villagers, knowing that their assignment may prove to be fatal. The climactic battle with the raiding thieves remains one of the most breathtaking sequences ever filmed. It's poetry in hyperactive motion and one of Kurosawa's crowning cinematic achievements. This is not a film that can be well served by any synopsis; it must be seen to be appreciated (accept nothing less than its complete 203-minute version) and belongs on the short list of any definitive home-video library.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K0YM0Y", "B001BEK8E2", "B000K0YLZ0", "B00005B1ZL", "B007N5YK10", "B002E01MBA", "B00K5EJHGO", "B00005JLEJ", "B00687XNNK", "B0009WIE2A", "B004XQO8MS", "B001WLMOL4", "B000059TFW", "B000AQKUD6", "B00180R072", "B00005JLMU", "B000067IY6", "B00005UQ7T", "B000E5LEV0", "B000ASATM6", "B000BR6QCI", "B0001UZZSG", "B00005QAPH", "6305081034", "B0007989YS", "B00065GX0K", "B006H3KQSK", "B001PCNZJU", "B00005JLV7", "B005JJCMN0", "B000WEH74G", "B00065GX64", "6305028699", "B00AEFYSEA", "B000V7HFL4", "0792841409", "0780021061", "B000AQKUH2", "B005HK13S6", "B0017MO0U6", "B00B2BYXSQ", "B001LMU1B4", "B0040QYROA", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783225903", "B0045HCJTO", "0780021045", "B0012SY0E6", "B000055Y0X", "B00EO2I6W4", "B001LMU1C8", "B00158K0RO", "B00004W3HF", "B000MM0LEG", "B004S801ZO", "B008VF0Y02", "0780020707", "B000XPSC0C", "B00003CXBU", "B000025RE7", "B00006ADD5", "0780022343", "0783226039", "B000056NWP", "B00005NC66", "6305257450", "B002ZG4Q5W", "B007Y1NR1W", "6304698798", "B000FDECGA", "B002IVDLH8", "B004M66YUS", "B00004Y7HL", "B002VRNJDA", "0767830555", "B0010YSD7W", "B004L9GMBC", "B001O549G6", "B003ZEQMH8", "B002VWNIAY", "B000VARC3C", "B003152Z4U", "B002U6DVPS", "B0000B1ODQ", "B00AEBB89C", "B008Y5OVZ8", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0087ZG7R0", "B005VU9LO0", "B0006GANN2", "B00AEFYL6K", "B00004TJKI", "B00DHN8FXG", "B0006GAOJA", "B003AWRMCE", "B000PKG6O4", "B00003CXR4", "B00HE01030", "B00ENNBZ68", "B006LLY8LY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005VU9LO0", "B001BEK8E2", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00008RH1H"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 158968}, "asin": "0780020685", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51175A95QSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Samurai (Criterion Collection Spine #2)"}

Tucker plays a two-bit con man, Franklin Hatchett, framed for the prison breakout of a ruthless criminal. Hunted by both the police and the bad guys, Hatchett finds his only hope in a smarmy, self-serving television reporter played by the perfectly cast Charlie Sheen (Platoon), who agrees to protect the nervous, hapless patsy only to further his own career. The plot is at times just plain dumb, and the requisite car chases and explosions happen a bit too frequently. But Tucker's manic energy and off-the-wall humor, as he is thrown into situations of mistaken identity and mortal danger, make the movie a frenetic and entertaining romp.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303022928", "6302332729"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 317616}, "asin": "0780620801", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PV3P1SDRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Money Talks [VHS]"}

{"description": "Written by Carl Foreman (who was later blacklisted during the anticommunist hearings of the '50s) and superbly directed by Fred Zinnemann, this 1952 classic stars Gary Cooper as just-married lawman Will Kane, who is about to retire as a small-town sheriff and begin a new life with his bride (Grace Kelly) when he learns that gunslinger Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is due to arrive at high noon to settle an old score. Kane seeks assistance from deputies and townsfolk, but soon realizes he'll have to stand alone in his showdown with Miller and his henchmen. Innovative for its time, the suspenseful story unfolds in approximate real time (from 10:40 a.m. to high noon in an 84-minute film), and many interpreted Foreman's drama as an allegorical reflection of apathy and passive acceptance of Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist campaign. Political underpinnings aside, this remains a milestone of its genre (often referred to as the first &quot;adult&quot; Western), and Cooper is flawless in his Oscar-winning role.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792107683", "0792106989", "630150528X", "6301977297", "6304457316", "0783221347", "6300267938", "B000006N70", "0792837371", "B001KO1BCQ", "6300184951", "0783222955", "B003MG6FJY", "630197705X", "0792110188", "079284517X", "6300215741", "B00AEFYTEY", "6300181340", "6300268470", "B000MGTQ7K", "0783235607", "6301971558", "B0049985XW", "1558807780", "6302640504", "6300183513", "6303686796", "630442972X", "6301973410", "B0013D8L8Q", "6303402070", "B000XR9L50", "0800132009", "6300273210", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000059TFW", "0790743159", "B005AMJ31U", "B0035JHYJI", "0790743213", "6301978536", "630021639X", "0800113055", "6303057225", "6302360978", "6304359721", "B00003OSTO", "6300215644", "0790743531", "6300216500", "6301802330", "B00004RFFA", "6300216195", "630018224X", "0792110269", "079284520X", "6304039522", "0783235593", "0790758474", "6301599896", "6300215660", "6302484421", "1558804226", "6304429711", "6301973259", "6300183211", "0783236352", "B00005QATY", "6304071876", "6301797957", "0800104803", "6303072747", "6304359705", "0800100832", "6303953425", "6300181421", "630248443X", "6303027016", "6301734734", "0792837096", "6300267970", "0792107128", "6300213838", "6300216012", "6300216233", "6302484405", "0792102320", "6301586026", "0792838556", "6300183580", "6302054982", "0784011923", "6304039530", "630396155X", "B000GX7MMA", "6301969294", "6302484448", "B000005PPB"], "bought_together": ["0792107683", "0792106989"], "also_viewed": ["0800116917"]}, "price": 9.95, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 244368}, "asin": "0782008348", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4118FFB44JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Noon [VHS]"}
{"description": "This lightweight World War II comedy is an amiable wade through the South Pacific buoyed largely by Cary Grant's effortless leadership as the commander of a crippled submarine and by Tony Curtis's blue-eyed wiles as his street-hustler of a supply officer. The crew dodges the enemy in a barely seaworthy vessel held together with chewing gum and baling wire (and, in one instance, a woman's girdle!) and painted a blushing bright pink. The close quarters get even tighter when the sub takes on five young army nurses, a couple of Filipino families, and a goat. Though it has little of the zany knockabout humor that marks later Blake Edwards hits likeThe Pink Pantherand10and it almost wears out its premise at two hours, this easy-sailing comedy rolls along the gentle wakes from one fine mess to another with good humor and a bevy of coy close-quarters sex gags.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["630299005X", "B00C3ALLFS", "B00AEFY8ZE", "B0045HCJHG", "B000FZETR0", "B0002TSZHY", "B0001WTWS8", "B0001WTWWE", "6301278437", "630290899X", "6302862906", "B004GJYR7I", "B00E8G5HZ0", "B0066E6RD8", "0780614097", "B000O599YO", "0782006779", "B008D1Q1VU", "B0045HCJ9E", "B000051S3Z", "B006TTC5WC", "B00AEBB97S", "B000FTCLR6", "B000WTVZHQ", "6302227127", "6300988473", "B0001NBMH6", "B0009ML2JC", "B000XT1P5C", "6303102441", "B0009HLD3C", "6300268748", "B0018E03CW", "B000083C6R", "B00005A06N", "0783230478", "B00AEFYBA6", "0782006809", "B0000CBY1C", "B00005N5S3", "B00000F13T", "B00871C09S", "B00AEFXD1O", "6302241103", "6300268470", "6300181472", "B000059HGY", "6300184919", "6300215733", "6300215628", "B00004WZR1", "6301965671", "6304457391", "6300208192", "079284520X"], "also_viewed": ["B00C3ALLFS", "B000XFVIOY", "B000A8AX6I", "B00B4NLCEU", "B0086IMNRQ"]}, "price": 27.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 313773}, "asin": "0782006787", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517Q1H0VSBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Operation Petticoat [VHS]"}

Desperate to break away from the Mob's influence and live happily ever after, the daring dames hatch a plot to steal $2 million of Mafia money.

{"description": "Meryl Streep tried her hand at action films with this Curtis Hanson film and proved herself quite credible, bringing emotion as well as the willingness to kick butt. She plays a suburban mom and former white-water rafting guide who is taking her family on a raft trip for summer vacation. But overworked Dad (David Strathairn) can't make the trip, so she and her son leave without him--and walk right into trouble. Killers on the run (Kevin Bacon, John C. Reilly) abduct them and force Streep to take them down the most dangerous stretch of river to elude the cops. Hanson understands how to pace and construct this kind of action fodder, but it's strictly formula stuff, enlivened only by the depth of Streep's portrayal and the viciousness of Bacon's character.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CPTUOG4", "B0006HBZXS", "B0030BOCFU", "B000059XTI", "B00AMSQBSU", "B00008L3UM", "B00002E22E", "B005JZBOV0", "6305268827", "0784011710", "0783230583", "B001RTCP24", "B00007AJE1", "B000068MBW", "B00B27WTOK", "0783240171", "B00AEFXKZ8", "B00005LOKU", "6305213283", "B00005MEOU", "B00000F3FS", "0783225482", "B0013FCWUW", "B003ASLJK4", "B000RTB0R6", "B004SUDQ2W", "B004SIP71M", "0783225547", "B0002DB54A", "B00015YVDG", "B00CPTUMX4", "B00004STDN", "0767836359", "B000CS45TW", "B00AEBB9UK", "6305213305", "B002RSDW80", "B00102F5WK", "B0038N9WKU", "B00005JLQN", "B000CEV3M8", "0767810872", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000A2UBN4", "B00003CXQG", "B0045HCIY0", "B00AEFY6PQ", "B00AEFXZJE", "B000V6LSOA", "6305236569", "B0059XTUVI", "B000HT38IK", "B002NZK5R8", "6305128952", "630523650X", "B004SEUJOQ", "B000228EGS", "B0099114WO", "B0006GANOQ", "B00006HAWL", "B0043X1FNQ", "B0007ZEOPK", "B002O3Z50G", "B00009WVSL", "B00005ATZT", "B00000IQC2", "B00003CXKA", "B000FO0AA6", "B00AEFXX9Q", "B00009AOBI", "0800141806", "B0001GF2D8", "B005CFBZ3O", "B0045HCJ8K", "B00005T7HZ", "0790736411", "B00026ZG10", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005B6JZ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005RYKU", "B003L20IG0", "B00AEBB91E", "B003VZNAU8", "B0000JBALO", "B00001U0DU", "0783226896", "B00000IQC4", "B0045HCJJ4", "B000JYW5BE", "B002QW7AMG", "6304765258", "B00005JA9F", "B004AOECXI", "B00005N89S", "B00008L3UQ", "B000FFJYBG"], "bought_together": ["B0006HBZXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0006HBZXS", "0784011710", "B005JZBOV0", "B00JAQJMJ0"]}, "price": 5.03, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8586}, "asin": "0783222149", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51READ2NE5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The River Wild"}

{"description": "The second film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam trilogy moves from the brutality of war inPlatoonto its equally traumatic aftermath. Based on the memoir of combat veteran Ron Kovic, the film stars Tom Cruise as Kovic, whose gunshot wound in Vietnam left him paralyzed from the chest down. He is deeply embittered by neglect in a veteran's hospital and by the shattering of his patriotic idealism because of the horror and futility of the Vietnam conflict. While painfully and awkwardly adjusting to his disability and a changing definition of masculinity, Kovic joins the burgeoning movement of antiwar protest, culminating in a climactic appearance at the 1976 Democratic national convention. A powerfully intimate portrait that unfolds on an epic scale,Born on the Fourth of Julyis arguably Stone's best film (if you can forgive its often strident tone), and Cruise's Oscar-nominated role is uncompromising in its depiction of one man's personal anguish and political awakening.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["079284646X", "B006TTC5HC", "B0015D20FE", "B000ELL1R6", "B000B8QG22", "B000P0J09C", "B00031V21M", "B00005V9HI", "B003ELKNH2", "B004FQX59I", "B00AEBBA36", "B00AEFXR1K", "B000GAKDAG", "B00000IQC0", "B00005JN2Z", "B0018QPPXW", "B00AEBB86U", "B000065V3G", "B000035Z5G", "1888451785", "B00005PJ8T", "B00001ZWUS", "B00005B6JZ", "B0013FCWUW", "B0000YEEGM", "B000M4RG42", "B000RTB0R6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B004U7MR1Y", "0800141741", "0783226810", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000E1NXJ0", "B00005JA9F", "B00275EGWY", "B003ASLJOU", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JNTI", "B002OGMGV4", "B000CEXEWA", "0767830555", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00004RF82", "B00080ZG10", "B00005JK8K", "B004FQX5B6", "B000059TFO", "B000065U1N", "B00008G8M4", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B0000542CI", "B000O599YO", "B000G6BLHY", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00005J760", "0800141806", "B004SIP7ZS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005N5S2", "B0006GAOJA", "B000P0J09M", "B001MVWFAO", "B00AEBB95K", "B000C20VPA", "B0043X1FL8", "B000U788WU", "0767817745", "B003ASLJQI", "B004SIP7TE", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B000BRP4BM", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000CNESTE", "B00005JPKE", "B0004Z33EG", "B00000K0DQ", "B000GG4Y32", "B00005JL78", "B000059HAN", "6305428522", "B004AOECXI", "B000PAAJZ6", "B001TH92N4", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00BTYJYR6", "0783225733", "B0006GANN2", "0767836359", "B00008CMRK", "B004GJYRI2", "B003HKN52U", "0800177967", "B000FVQLRA", "B00011CZRE", "B00009W5CA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["079284646X", "B00001ZWUS", "B006TTC5HC", "B000B8QG22"]}, "price": 8.48, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 263904}, "asin": "0783226764", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510WBGNCT9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Born on the Fourth of July"}

{"description": "The original cowriter and director ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegaswas Alex Cox, whose earlier filmSid and Nancysuggests that Cox could have been a perfect match in filming  Hunter&nbsp;S. Thompson's psychotropic masterpiece of \"gonzo\" journalism. Unfortunately Cox departed due to the usual \"creative differences,\" and this ill-fated adaptation was thrust upon Terry Gilliam, whose formidable gifts as a visionary filmmaker were squandered on the seemingly unfilmable elements of Thompson's ether-fogged narrative. The result is a one-joke movie without the joke--an endless series of repetitive scenes involving rampant substance abuse and the hallucinogenic fallout of a road trip that's run crazily out of control. Johnny Depp plays Thompson's alter ego, \"gonzo\" journalist Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro is his sidekick and so-called lawyer Dr. Gonzo. During the course of a trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, they ingest a veritable chemistry set of drugs, and Gilliam does his best to show us the hallucinatory state of their zonked-out minds. This allows for some dazzling imagery and the rampant humor of stumbling buffoons, and the mumbling performances of Depp and Del Toro wholeheartedly embrace the tripped-out, paranoid lunacy of Thompson's celebrated book. But over two hours of this insanity tends to grate on the nerves--like being the only sober guest at a party full of drunken idiots. So while Gilliam's film may achieve some modest cult status over the years, it's only becauseFear and Loathingis best enjoyed by those who are just as stoned as the characters in the movie.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006H32EI", "B006ISJQ1W", "B00003CXWV", "0767837398", "B002AF4Y9G", "B000A7DVR2", "B001EDFSIQ", "0679785892", "B0057ZAA6W", "6305313687", "B00029RTAI", "B0007DFJ0G", "B002QEHPQU", "B00008975Z", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005JM23", "B000F7CECK", "B000JMK6LW", "B000093FLA", "B000P0J09M", "B003HKN52U", "0783225903", "B00005R87R", "B004SIP95G", "B00000IRE6", "B000031EFY", "B00005ATQB", "B005Y4I6VW", "B0006HBZE2", "B00005Q4CS", "B004FQX5B6", "B009NNXQJW", "B0000VD04M", "B00006JDU8", "B00005V9HH", "B00011CZRE", "B002T9H2LA", "B000C20VPA", "B002CPMB9O", "B000AXWHSA", "B000ASDFI6", "B000P0J0D8", "0792838068", "B003W88QVC", "B00029RTCG", "B0011E5M66", "B0007PALZ2", "B00005JMJG", "B007D0FVRM", "B001J9KJ4I", "B006ISJQBM", "B000EMGJAO", "B0000CDUT5", "B000KB4898", "B0000AC8LR", "B004P7CNC2", "B004SIP7TE", "B00AEFXE9U", "B004SIP8ES", "B00AEFYS2M", "B000C20VRS", "B0000AC8LI", "B00ALU48M0", "B0009A40ES", "B000LP6KNU", "B00H9KKGTO", "B00AEBB8NI", "B0000640VJ", "B004SIP6LS", "B000286RP2", "B000GGSMC6", "0780621611", "B001HN694K", "B00009W5CA", "B004XVMCH6", "B001GCUO0W", "B000GBEWGQ", "B0006GAOJA", "B008R65XYC", "B000IY04Q8", "B000006NN1", "B000S6M1Y4", "B0012E2GFK", "B0007UC8Y4", "B0043X1FM2", "B0001CNRRU", "B00ALU46VI", "0767835093", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005NTOH", "B000MMMT9G", "B005LAIIJY", "B00AG4714S", "B00000K3TS", "B000053VAZ", "B00009MGEM", "B001M4YZ90", "B002ZG980U", "1451659717"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXWV"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679785892", "B00029RTAI", "0783225903", "B000A7DVR2"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3274}, "asin": "0783229526", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LL2U2I2AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"}
{"description": "Spike Lee's semiautobiographical, 1994 film about the good and bad times for a Brooklyn family in the '70s has passion and nostalgic good feeling, but it is also a mess of random reflections and arbitrary storytelling. The centerpiece of the movie is a little girl (Zelda Harris) who views the ups and downs of her parents' experiences (mom and dad are played by Delroy Lindo and Alfre Woodard), and who navigates the life of her neighborhood. Lee tosses in a lot of '70s detail (watchingThe Partridge Family) and other diversions (Harris's journey through suburbia), but he has no master sensibility controlling the flow of it all. The film is more wearying than anything, although bright spots include Lindo's fine performance as a talented man suffering from irrelevance.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000TWMTS", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00007L4KF", "B00066FAQW", "6305505780", "B00000JGHV", "B00007AJG2", "B000051YMS", "B002CA68NO", "1558908390", "B00004Y2R1", "B002CWKU36", "B00008977B", "B000BOH8X2", "B00465I1CE", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B000BITV9W", "B0041QSZS8", "B0009S4IGA", "B0024EWP6W", "B00066FAVW", "0767821955", "B00ANDDBBY", "B00AEFYE08", "B00AEBB9AA", "B0000TWMWK", "B001K98MGE", "B00DW5IL2E", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005U156", "0780627822", "B000P0J092", "B00008978S", "B00007AJG1", "B002GSXKOM", "B004SIP93S", "B001DJLD12", "B00AEFY6TW", "B00AEFYG3S", "B0000JBUHI", "B0000YEE6M", "B00066FAC6", "B0000549B2", "B000035P5I", "B000TLOMPE", "B004FK5EDY", "B002CA68N4", "0767813901", "6304821832", "B00000JGHO", "B00003CY51", "B00007BK2Q", "B00003W8NT", "B00066FAD0", "B000YAF4Q6", "B00005JLG1", "B000JLTRH2", "B002VWNICM", "B000A2XAQ4", "B000JRYOPG", "B00005ASOO", "B001P3SA94", "B000069I0E", "B00007GZRP", "B0006H32DO", "0783230389", "630514415X", "B00AEFYQWO", "B00005JD5J", "B003NH6FY2", "B000XT1P52", "0783237367", "B00005JLON", "B00007BK2S", "B00007ELEO", "B00769U94K", "B000FS9ULC", "B000BUE5FA", "B000BTITFI", "B00GOZ2LPM", "B0000TWMWA", "B00008MTYF", "0767811070", "0783240201", "B00005B8UA", "B00005JND5", "B00AEFXP8K", "B003Y5H56K", "B008NNY8SQ", "B00AEFXY6I", "B000060MWA", "B002VECM4A", "B0014QLEI6", "B000P0J0CE", "B000PE0GRI", "B0006QAIG4", "B0002CTSV8", "B003Y5H4ZC", "B00005TQ44"], "bought_together": ["B00BTYPWDQ", "6305505780"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYPWDQ", "6305505780", "B000E40QC4", "B00004Y2R1"]}, "price": 6.66, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 16449}, "asin": "0783230524", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51STBTYYAGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crooklyn"}

{"description": "A glossy romantic comedy,The Best Mancenters on four college friends and the women in their lives, all brought back together for a wedding. Taye Diggs (How Stella Got Her Groove Back) plays the title character, a young writer whose first novel is a barely fictionalized account of his college days, featuring barely fictionalized versions of all his friends. This novel hasn't yet been released, but ambitious TV producer Nia Long (Soul Food) has snagged an advance copy in the hopes of getting an early interview with Diggs. Unfortunately, when this advance copy begins circulating among the college gang, they discover it reveals some secrets that may have a disastrous effect on the wedding.The Best Manfeatures a handsome, charming cast and a propulsive story, but the female characters are poorly developed and the male banter is, to say the least, chauvinistic. This banter is mostly to comic effect, but by the end it still leaves a sour taste that the movie's happy ending doesn't counter.

{"description": "Proving that he may be the most fearless actor of his or any other generation, Harvey Keitel gives an amazing, no-holds-barred performance in director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1992 film about a New York cop on the edge of self-annihilation. The film's title is meant to be taken literally: Keitel's character has no redeeming values whatsoever, save for his desperate need for redemption. Leonard Maltin'sMovie & Video Guideis correct in calling this an \"over-the-top Catholic guilt movie,\" but it's been made with such conviction that Ferrara and Keitel transcend the sheer unpleasantness of the material to give it a kind of tragic divinity. Here's a character so vile and corrupted that he consumes or re-sells the drugs he confiscates, but when he's assigned to investigate the brutal rape of a nun who refuses to press charges, he feels that this is his opportunity to redeem his rotten soul. Deservedly rated NC-17 due to its rough content and a frontal nude scene that even Keitel's most loyal fans could do without, this film tends to divide viewers into love-it-or-hate-it categories, but few could deny its raw power and the deeply anguished humanity that Keitel brings to his role. Whatever your reaction may be, few would deny this is an unforgettable film.--Jeff Shannon", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 241507}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Bad Lieutenant", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0001FGBUW", "B002TVQ48K", "B000286RP2", "B00005O5AY", "6305594333", "B0001US62I", "6305505802", "0767830555", "0767802519", "B00JV0547O", "0783230443", "B00008975Z", "0792838068", "B000A2UBN4", "B0006GAOJA", "B000063JDE", "B000CQLZ0Q", "B003KGBISE", "B000P0J0D8", "B00006RCNV", "B002AF4Y9G", "B0000DI87S", "B004KDYR20", "B00008RH3L", "B00008K7AO", "0792833287", "B0064MT1FI", "B00005UQ9T", "B00005R2IS", "B00005QBZA", "B00002RAO2", "B001B1UO7G", "B0057ZAA6W", "B000PAAJZ6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B003L20IEC", "B00GOT11TA", "B00062IVM6", "B0000542CB", "0790729342", "B00005Y6XB", "B0009OUBC4", "B00AEBB95K", "B0045HCJSU", "B00000IC7G", "B0001FGBW0", "B00005V9HH", "B00LEW3L5Y", "B000059TFP", "B003TRMLQM", "B00125WATQ", "B000QXDCLK", "B001AS32QK", "B004SIP6WW", "B003ELKNH2", "B000022TS6", "B000JU7JIW", "B000C20VRS", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B00005QCVX", "B00007L4KI", "B0001EFV7C", "B00112S8RS", "B0024EWP6W", "B00JJ3EHCG", "B0009X768W", "B000UO4F7U", "B000286RPM", "B00009W5CA", "B009POCG0Y", "B001TOD92C", "B00027JYBW", "0792846435", "B000BR9S96", "B001152TL6", "B006KH6CF4", "B00HVOFP6W", "B000A7DVR2", "B000929UOQ", "B0041QSZS8", "B00699G622", "B0006HBV3C", "B00005JLJW", "B000CNESTE", "B0007P0X9G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004YCKKFK", "B00004XPPB", "B00005JN2Z", "B00005YJMX", "B00005Q4CS", "B00005QAOZ", "B00GDDNFDW", "B00151QYSK", "6305313687", "B00049QQHI", "B000BBOUW2", "B000089770", "B00003CXZ4", "B0000AQS1H"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002TVQ48K", "B0001FGBUW", "B001V32UF8", "B002T9H2LA"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519HBKXXMTL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "0784011559"}

{"description": "Holy Mancould have been a stellar satire in the tradition of  Frank Capra, George Stevens, or Preston Sturges. Instead, this well-meaning romantic comedy was bluntly written by Tom Schulman (Dead Poets Society) and broadly directed by Stephen Herek, who fared better with his 1995 dramaMr.&nbsp;Holland's Opus. Their good intentions shine through, however, and while it's easy to appreciate Eddie Murphy's attempt to shift his career in a more substantial direction,Holy Mandelivers some pointed criticism of commercialism and its deadening effect on spiritual well-being.Murphy plays an enlightened eccentric named \"G\" (for \"guru\" or \"God\"?) who rises to national celebrity when he's enlisted to host a TV shopping network. Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Preston play the show's producer and marketer, respectively, and their formulaic romance provides the movie's lackluster subplot. With skyrocketing ratings and a flurry of cameos by celebrity hucksters (Morgan Fairchild, Florence Henderson, Dan Marino, and even James Brown), G delivers preachy platitudes urging America to stop buying and embrace the finer values of life and love (a hollow message coming from Disney, the most conspicuously commercial of all major Hollywood studios). To its credit,Holy Manoccasionally achieves a delicate balance of comedy and commentary, and receptive viewers will be grateful, at a time when crude comedies rule the box office, that someone bothered to try. For that reason, this flawed movie deserves to be seen.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000035Z3C", "B001F7Q4IY", "B00AEFYB1A", "B00AG472HY", "B00003CXWS", "B00BTYRB2G", "B00005JM4W", "B000085EFK", "630587493X", "B000FO0A9W", "B00AEFYQWO", "B000069I1H", "B000CEV3M8", "B005LAIGW8", "630471193X", "0783227396", "B0007KIFGE", "B000FO0AA6", "B00003CXJ1", "0767812166", "B00008979N", "0783228058", "B003CWEQFS", "B0001A79EO", "0783225482", "B000J10EQU", "078322740X", "B0062MDNEK", "0767851161", "B000CBP02A", "B00008G8LM", "B00005PJ6O", "B000BJ7BCK", "B002GHHHKQ", "B008JFUS0U", "B0012RWQJ8", "B00020FTO0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B04NIU4", "B00803PG80", "B00003CXWS", "B000035Z3C"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 171602}, "asin": "0788814907", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AF56HF2YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Holy Man"}

The director's kinetic style is perfect for recounting Hill's ruthless rise to power in the 1950s as well as his drugged-out fall in the late 1970s; in fact, no one has ever rendered the mental dislocation of cocaine better than Scorsese. Scorsese uses period music perfectly, not just to summon a particular time but to set a precise mood.GoodFellasis at least as good asThe Godfatherwithout being in the least derivative of it.

{"description": "Director William Friedkin was a hot ticket in Hollywood after the success ofThe French Connection, and he turned heads (in more ways than one) when he decided to makeThe Exorcistas his follow-up film. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from hiscontroversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl (Linda Blair) who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and Ellen Burstyn plays Blair's mother, who can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. One of the most frightening films ever made,The Exorcistwas mysteriously plagued by troubles during production, and the years have not diminished its capacity to disturb even the most stoical viewers.

{"description": "From its cleverly choreographed opening sequence to its heart-stopping climax on a rampant carousel, this 1951 Hitchcock classic readily earns its reputation as one of the director's finest examples of timeless cinematic suspense. It's not just a ripping-good thriller but a film student's delight and a perversely enjoyable battle of wits between tennis pro Guy (Farley Granger) and his mysterious, sycophantic admirer, Bruno (Robert Walker), who proposes a &quot;criss-cross&quot; scheme of traded murders. Bruno agrees to kill Guy's unfaithful wife, in return for which Guy will (or so it seems) kill Bruno's spiteful father. With an emphasis on narrative and visual strategy, Hitchcock controls the escalating tension with a master's flair for cinematic design, and the plot (coscripted by Raymond Chandler) is so tightly constructed that you'll be white-knuckled even after multiple viewings.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B000ECX0O2", "B0045HCJ9E", "B00871C09S", "B0087ZG7R0", "B001D8W7EK", "B00000CQJZ", "B000A9QK7I", "B00AEBB97S", "B000CCW2TS", "B001D8W7F4", "B000ECX0Q0", "B0002HOEQM", "B001D8W7EU", "B0087ZG7OI", "B00000C0QO", "B002GSXKQA", "B000CCW2U2", "B0002HOER6", "B0087ZG7PW", "B000ECX0S8", "6305999872", "B00AEBB89C", "B003ZEQMH8", "B0002HOEQW", "B00004XPPK", "B000A1INJE", "B00008LDNZ", "B0002HOEQC", "B000CCW2UW", "B000FFJYA2", "B009RWRINE", "B000CCW2UC", "B0002HOEPS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B002VWNIAY", "B005EVY8MQ", "B0006HBV3C", "B0010YSD7W", "B00K6D1QV8", "B000025RE7", "B005H8G78O", "B000MGBSDK", "B007Y1NR1W", "B000PMFRVU", "B00005LC4D", "B0009ML1Z2", "B00065GX64", "B0045HCJQW", "B00AEBBA7W", "B00003CXBZ", "B000244F2S", "B0000549B1", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B008BFSMBA", "B000ECX0QU", "B000FFJYAW", "B004NWPY3E", "B00006RCO1", "B00005AUK9", "B0045HCJ8U", "B00AEFYO5I", "B0008ENIAC", "B00005JKF6", "B000CNE088", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00005RDRL", "B000UVV25Q", "B002945DUM", "B0045HCJHG", "B00AEFXD1O", "B0002ERWZ0", "078323502X", "B000KGGJ1I", "B00003CXBU", "B006TTC5WC", "B000KIX8VK", "B00000JNVC", "B00004W229", "B004CZRE44", "B00AEBB8OC", "B00AMEZDK6", "B000FFJYAC", "B006FE83UE", "B0007US7EY", "B0010AN7Z4", "B000CNE08I", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00553K8DQ", "B000B8380A", "B000244EYW", "B0009S4IKQ", "B00074DY0M", "B00004TJKI", "B005152C9G"], "bought_together": ["B0002HOEQ2", "B0045HCJ9E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00871C09S", "B0002HOEQ2", "B000CCW2SY", "B0045HCJ9E"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.89, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790731029", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J4BhbK2UL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Strangers on a Train"}
{"description": "The most viscerally frightening and disturbing homicidal-maniac picture sinceThe Silence of the Lambs,Sevenis based on an idea that's both gruesome and ingenious. A serial killer forces each of his victims to die by acting out one of the seven deadly sins. The murder scene is then artfully arranged into a grotesque tableau, a graphic illustration of each mortal vice. From the jittery opening credits to the horrifying (and seemingly inescapable) concluding twist, director David Fincher immerses us in a murky urban twilight where everything seems to be rotting, rusting, or molding; the air is cold and heavy with dread. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives who skillfully track down the killer--all the while unaware that he has been closing in on them, as well. Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are also featured, but it is director Fincher and the ominous, overwhelmingly oppressive atmosphere of doom that he creates that are the real stars of the film. It's a terrific date movie--for vampires.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000M341QE", "0783240295", "B00003CXZ4", "6305313687", "B004SIP8ZM", "B000P0J0EW", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B000069HZP", "B004SIP95G", "B0009A40ES", "B0007PALZ2", "B002NZK5RI", "B002AF4Y9G", "B00AEBB89W", "B004SIP7VM", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00004BZIY", "B003ASLJO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00096S49Y", "B00AEFYF2K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00008975Z", "B002T9H2LA", "B00005JLKN", "B000LC55F2", "0767802519", "B004FQX5B6", "B002VWNIEA", "B004SIP7TE", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00AEFXEGS", "0792846435", "B00003CXSP", "B002VWNICC", "B00AEFXT1S", "B000C20VPA", "B00AEFXESQ", "B000P0J0EM", "B000093FLA", "B002ZG99N6", "B002NZK5VO", "B003LR5BD0", "B002VWNIDG", "B000I2J736", "B0001FR3IQ", "B00AEFYYH6", "B000F5GNX8", "B002ZG980U", "B00005JN0W", "B00005JMJG", "B0000AC8LR", "B003ASLJQI", "B000E5N684", "B002XMGGK6", "B003HKN52U", "B00AP2DC94", "B00001ZWUS", "B000A2UBN4", "B000244GCW", "B000A7DVR2", "B002GHHHN8", "B00004WG2F", "B00AEFXKUI", "B001R3YRG2", "B002NZK5UU", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P7G", "B000FKO5QK", "B0009MDPYM", "B000NVT0SO", "B003ASLJQS", "B00005JPD0", "B00005JKWX", "B000YAF4MA", "B00005JKIS", "6305065551", "0783229526", "0783233477", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00005JA8B", "B00AEFXYJA", "B0000YEEGM", "B007D5E7C2", "B0002V7ON8", "B000N6U0E2", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB8LA", "6305718954", "B002AT8K9W", "B00AMSLDTM", "B000FS9FCG"], "bought_together": ["B0007DFJ0G", "6305313687"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZW4M", "B00005V9HH", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000P0J0EW"]}, "price": 13.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 172718}, "asin": "0790729989", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VQ890AJML._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven (Widescreen)"}
{"description": "After his successful direction of the Broadway hitsBarefoot in the ParkandThe Odd Couple,Mike Nichols made his filmmaking debut with this outstanding and still-powerful screen adaptation (by Ernest Lehman) of Edward Albee's taboo-shattering play. In their fourth film together (and by far their finest), Richard Burton and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor play a New England couple whose marriage hangs by a thin thread of self-deception, vicious verbal jousting, and embittered mutual need. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who also won an Oscar) play the younger, unsuspecting couple who awkwardly witness the devastating rivalry of their hosts. Handling adult themes with intelligence and forceful dramatic impact, this was the film that finally shattered Hollywood's self-censoring Production Code with commercially successful results.

{"description": "One of the key movies of the 1970s, when exciting, groundbreaking, personal films were still being made in Hollywood, Milos Forman'sOne Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestemphasized the humanistic story at the heart of Ken Kesey's more hallucinogenic novel. Jack Nicholson was born to play the part of Randle Patrick McMurphy, the rebellious inmate of a psychiatric hospital who fights back against the authorities' cold attitudes of institutional superiority, as personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It's the classic antiestablishment tale of one man asserting his individuality in the face of a repressive, conformist system--and it works on every level. Forman populates his film with memorably eccentric faces, and gets such freshly detailed and spontaneous work from his ensemble that the picture sometimes feels like a documentary. Unlike a lot of films pitched at the &quot;youth culture&quot; of the 1970s,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nestreally hasn't dated a bit, because the qualities of human nature that Forman captures--playfulness, courage, inspiration, pride, stubbornness--are universal and timeless. The film swept the Academy Awards for 1976, winning in all the major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) for the first time since Frank Capra'sIt Happened One Nightin 1931.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002VWNIDG", "B000RTB0R6", "B006TTC5HC", "B000FVQLQQ", "B000P0J0EW", "0767830555", "B0043X1FL8", "B00003CWQR", "B004SIP7ZS", "B003ELKNH2", "B0006GAOJA", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXN9G", "0767811100", "0792833287", "B004SIP95G", "B0000YEEGM", "B00079Z9VO", "0451163966", "B00AEFYSWM", "B000P0J09M", "B008MIMWP8", "B000EHQU0S", "B006FE83UE", "B000M341QE", "B00AEFXESQ", "B00002VWE0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B002VWNIAY", "B00009W5CA", "0764586629", "B000ZM1MGE", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J09C", "B0008ENHUI", "B00005V9HH", "B0019L770A", "B0019L21GA", "B00AEBB9CS", "B0050FXDDQ", "B000CNESTE", "B0006GANN2", "B000LP6KNU", "B000P0J0EM", "B00000IQV7", "B000055Y0X", "B00001ZWUS", "079073219X", "B0019UGYK0", "079284646X", "B00AEBB9F0", "B003ASLJO0", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEBB9FA", "B0002B15ZG", "B004U7MR3M", "B000YAF4MA", "B0007DFJ0G", "B00066FBQG", "B00005JKIS", "6305144168", "B004SIP7TE", "B002ZG980U", "B00005ATQB", "B0045HCJ94", "0783229526", "B000A3XY5A", "B000093FLA", "B00026ZD04", "B004L9GMBC", "B0000DI87S", "B00006RCO1", "B0007PALZ2", "B0000JBALO", "B004IFYMYI", "B007N31YH0", "B000P0J0D8", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00B0U2SFE", "0792846443", "B007D0FVRM", "B000022TSY", "B0087ZG7UW", "B0002234LS", "B0045HCJ9E", "B0000A02TZ", "B001GD6VTE", "B00AEFYRP0", "0784011710", "B00009AOAZ", "B00005JLSB", "B000Q678OO", "0792838408", "6305882592", "B003LMPKSQ", "B00005MEOU", "B00AEFYSL8", "B0057ZAA6W", "B001AEF6BI", "B000HC2LHG"], "bought_together": ["B002VWNIDG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000P0J0EW", "0451163966", "B006TTC5HC", "B00AEFY0F2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40218}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "WARNER STUDIOS", "asin": "0790732181", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pJoIlXFbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"}

{"description": "A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, John Ford'sThe Searchershas earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western--the hero (or antihero) who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. The story takes place in Texas in 1868; Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran who visits his brother and sister-in-law at their ranch and is horrified when they are killed by marauding Comanches. Ethan's search for a surviving niece (played by young Natalie Wood) becomes an all-consuming obsession. With the help of a family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is himself part Cherokee, Ethan hits the trail on a five-year quest for revenge. At the peak of his masterful talent, director Ford crafts this classic tale as an embittered examination of racism and blind hatred, provoking Wayne to give one of the best performances of his career. As with many of Ford's classic Westerns,The Searchersmust contend with revisionism in its stereotypical treatment of \"savage\" Native Americans, and the film's visual beauty (the final shot is one of the great images in all of Western culture) is compromised by some uneven performances and stilted dialogue. Still, this is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300268470", "630197705X", "0792106989", "6301325508", "0782008348", "6303057225", "6300181588", "6300268799", "0792102320", "6301797922", "6301802330", "6303192254", "0792838556", "6301805518", "6304071876", "6301798759", "6300184951", "6300269884", "6300267830", "1555265952", "6300181715", "0792107128", "6303599052", "6300208281", "0783221347", "B00004RFFA", "6304457308", "6304457278", "079284517X", "6301977165", "6300268748", "B000051S3Z", "B001E419N8", "B000M7BEPQ", "B000GX4476", "0792110188", "6301628454", "6300988473", "0800132009", "B000059HGY", "6301805615", "B00004WZR1", "6301670159", "0792107683", "630310374X", "0783235607", "6303942830", "6302884438", "6305237115", "630150528X", "0792834879", "0790743213", "0783235593", "6304259131", "6301798503", "630018224X", "6302130379", "B000006N70", "6304935811"], "also_viewed": ["6303599052", "6303168507", "6300269884", "6301802330", "0792106989"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 293111}, "asin": "0790736918", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G79RSPRAL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Searchers [VHS]"}
{"description": "The opening and closing moments of Robert (Forrest Gump) Zemeckis'sContactastonish viewers with the sort of breathtaking conceptual imagery one hardly ever sees in movies these days--each is an expression of the heroine's lifelong quest (both spiritual and scientific) to explore the meaning of human existence through contact with extraterrestrial life. The movie begins by soaring far out into space, then returns dizzyingly to earth until all the stars in the heavens condense into the sparkle in one little girl's eye. It ends with that same girl as an adult (Jodie Foster)--her search having taken her to places beyond her imagination--turning her gaze inward and seeing the universe in a handful of sand.Contacttraces the journey between those two visual epiphanies. Based on Carl Sagan's novel,Contactis exceptionally thoughtful and provocative for a big-budget Hollywood science fiction picture, with elements that recall everything from2001toThe Right Stuff. Foster's solid performance (and some really incredible alien hardware) keep viewers interested, even when the story skips and meanders, or when the halo around the golden locks of rising-star-of-a-different-kind Matthew McConaughey (as the pure-Hollywood-hokum love interest) reaches Milky Way-level wattage. Ambitious, ambiguous, pretentious, unpredictable--Contactis all of these things and more. Much of it remains open to speculation and interpretation, but whatever conclusions one eventually draws,Contactdeserves recognition as a rare piece of big-budget studio filmmaking on a personal scale.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002V7OI8", "0783225733", "B0045HCJ9O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00008G8LY", "B00003CWU3", "B0045HCJ0S", "B0006FYOTC", "0671004107", "630471193X", "B002O3Z50G", "B000VECAD0", "B004GJYRI2", "630542845X", "B00000G3PA", "B002ZG980U", "B000BYY11Y", "B00005JL3T", "B0000844I8", "B00I116MUC", "B00013RC84", "B0050MB5KM", "B0087F7VSY", "B00008OE4W", "B00006JDVV", "B0015NORDW", "B00004BZIY", "B003AWRMBA", "B00003CXXP", "B00E8G5HQE", "B00IWULQQ2", "B007Y1NNAW", "B0000A2ZO0", "0783225547", "B00005JKFR", "B001BEK8CY", "B000E6ESEO", "0767812166", "B000OA8OK4", "B00007GZR5", "6305133468", "B001GCUO02", "B005LAII3A", "0767805712", "B000NA1WDQ", "B00005JNY3", "B000YDOOHI", "B000ENC5YW", "B002NZK5UU", "079073639X", "B0043X1FL8", "B00000JMOD", "B004SIP9RO", "0783225814", "B00004YA66", "B000FVQLKW", "B00008G8M4", "B00005JOC9", "B000CEV3M8", "B000CEXEWA", "B001BRJZPW", "B001451HXO", "B0045HCJKS", "B007RGAC7G", "B00AEBB9F0", "B00AEFY3MC", "B00000IQW5", "B001ECDVK4", "B004AOECXI", "B0013FDM7E", "B000053VBK", "B002GHHHP6", "B00AEFXPSK", "B0007PLLBU", "B00AEFY0F2", "B002GHHHNI", "B000PGINMQ", "B0007TKNHE"], "bought_together": ["B0002V7OI8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004L9GMBC", "B002ZG980U", "0671004107", "B000VECAD0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 88991}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.49, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "0790733226", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412wFQ6h37L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Contact (Snap Case)"}

At the other end of those train tracks is Hollywood, where he catches the eye of someone from Central Casting who thinks he'd make a good gangster type in the movies. Full-fledged stardom is only a reel change away--whereupon that old gang of his comes sniffing around. Some of this is diverting, some is just sloppy; the film gives the impression of having had different writers assigned from scene to scene.

Romero - conjure up five shocking yarns, each a virtuoso exercise in the ghouls-and-gags style of classic '50s horror comics. A murdered man emerges from the grave for Father's Day cake. A meteor's ooze makes everything ... grow. A professor selects his wife as a snack for a crated creature. A scheming husband plants two lovers up to their necks in terror. A malevolent millionaire with an insect phobia becomes the prey of a cockroach army. Add the spirited performances of a fine cast (Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, E.G.

{"description": "An outstanding drama,Gallipoliresonates with sadness long after you have seen it. Set during World War I, this brutally honest antiwar movie was cowritten by director Peter Weir. Mark Lee and a sinfully handsome Mel Gibson are young, idealistic best friends who put aside their hopes and dreams when they join the war effort. This character study follows them as they enlist and are sent to Gallipoli to fight the Turks. The first half of the film is devoted to their lives and their strong friendship. The second half details the doomed war efforts of the Aussies, who are no match for the powerful and aggressive Turkish army. Because the script pulls us into their lives and forces us to care for these young men, we are devastated by their fate.--Rochelle O'Gorman", "related": {"also_bought": ["630150528X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 397944}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.31, "brand": "", "asin": "0792106164", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S3W8BKXPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gallipoli [VHS]"}
{"description": "\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That's more than the code of a newspaperman inThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; it's practically the operating credo of director John Ford, the most honored of American filmmakers. In this late film from a long career, Ford looks at the civilizing of an Old West town, Shinbone, through the sad memories of settlers looking back. In the town's wide-open youth, two-fisted Westerner John Wayne and tenderfoot newcomer James Stewart clash over a woman (Vera Miles) but ultimately unite against the notorious outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Ford's nostalgia for the past is tempered by his stark approach, unusual for the visual poet ofStagecoachandThe Searchers. The two heavyweights, Wayne and Stewart, are good together, with Wayne the embodiment of rugged individualism and Stewart the idealistic prophet of the civilization that will eventually tame the Wild West.

{"description": "The fourth Pink Panther film with Peter Sellers and directed by Blake Edwards is easily the most over-the-top, but it's still pretty entertaining. The story finds Clouseau's former boss (Herbert Lom) totally insane after years of enduring the bumbling detective, and sequestered in a castle with a death-ray gun. Clouseau has to stop him from using the weapon on the world, and his efforts to do so make for some choice, Edwards-style slapstick. The quotient of destruction (a Clouseau staple) is higher than average, but there is also real wit--particularly in a final scene where Lom re-creates his most famous role as the monster from the 1962Phantom of the Opera.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792834895", "6301976835", "6302884438", "0792834879"], "bought_together": ["0792834895", "6301976835"], "also_viewed": ["0792834879", "6302884438"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 400696}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.51, "brand": "", "asin": "0792834852", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SD6YS2FCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pink Panther Strikes Again [VHS]"}
{"description": "The only remaining evidence that Sylvester Stallone might have had a respectable career, this 1976 Oscar winner (for Best Picture, Director, and Editing) is still the quintessential ode to an underdog and one of the best boxing movies ever made. After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a &quot;million-to-one shot&quot; against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can't help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Gus (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian's hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I", "B0006GAOGI", "B000N4SHPS", "B0006GAOGS", "B007STBUHI", "B00005MEOU", "B000ICM5O4", "B00AEFY0F2", "6304907729", "B00004W221", "B000IJ79UW", "B00000HZY2", "B007N31YH0", "B00004XPPC", "B004FQX5A2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B00003CXBU", "B0008JIJ2E", "B000XJD34I", "B007SPPANM", "B000ARTN3I", "B0001US8F8", "B000KX0IOA", "B003ASLJQI", "0792843592", "0780021312", "B00079Z9VO", "B00J2AU8MY", "B001LXIDVI", "B0068FZ0GK", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000BYA4HE", "B000EHRVOW", "B00006ADD5", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00066FBQG", "B000BITV92", "B0087ZG7HK", "B000IJ79WU", "B000059H9A", "B000ZM1MG4", "B0002WZTOI", "B0001US66Y", "B0049985XW", "B001GZ6QC4", "B000VECAD0", "B006FE83UE", "0792838041", "0800177258", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005JKCH", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008K76U", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001AEF6BS", "B00004BZIY", "B004QBWU02", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00011D1OK", "B00004TVUD", "B000HE2ZUW"], "bought_together": ["B0006GAOG8", "B0006GAO6I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000WC3A0S", "B004FQX5C0", "B00J4BW10S", "B000N4SHPS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 405226}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.85, "brand": "", "asin": "079283321X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AP5MY2B5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rocky (1976)"}

{"description": "Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel has been the basis of three big-screen adaptations, beginning with the 1956 chillerInvasion of the Body Snatchersand most recently as 1994's underratedBody Snatchers. This acclaimed 1978 version from director Philip Kaufman (The Right Stuff) is every bit as creepy as the '56 original, and it fits perfectly into the cycle of paranoid thrillers that thrived in American movies of the 1970s. Kaufman stylishly directs from an intelligent screenplay by W.D. Richter, while Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams lead a distinguished cast (including Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, and Veronica Cartwright) and must fight for survival as the population of San Francisco is systematically cloned by alien &quot;pods&quot; from a distant, dying planet. The atmosphere of dread and paranoia grows increasingly intense as the complexity of the alien invasion is gradually revealed, until nobody can be trusted to be who they appear. Finely tuned performances enhance the film's eerie atmosphere, highlighted by moments that will lurk in your memory long after the movie's over. MGM's DVD release includes a full-length audio commentary by Kaufman, a &quot;pod culture&quot; retrospective,Body Snatcherstrivia, production notes, and the original theatrical trailer.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JPUN", "B0045HCJ8A", "B000AQKU72", "B0045HCJKS", "B00009NHC0", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00005JKFR", "B00518A70E", "B000063UR0", "B000FVQLKW", "B0013D8LAE", "B0045HCJSA", "B0087ZG7PW", "B00026L8US", "B00008438U", "B00000IQC4", "B000V4UFZK", "B0013LL2Z2", "B000EHQTZO", "B000VECAD0", "B000QGEB1W", "B001GCUO0W", "B006TTC5J0", "B000RXVNDI", "B0016I0AJG", "B00AEBB94G", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000P0J0BU", "B001D5C1OO", "B004L9GMBC", "B0045HCJJE", "B001BGS17Q", "B000FFJZO2", "B000O78KWE", "6304723113", "B000FOPPEC", "B00009NHBC", "0783225903", "B000E6ESEY", "B00006G8K0", "B00158K1EQ", "B00153ZR8G", "B000EHSVNW", "B002NZK5U0", "B00005LC4L", "B0006B2A42", "B00007JMD8", "0783240953", "B000HEWEDK", "B004LB5FAO", "B000063UR1"], "bought_together": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B000AQKU72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007Y1NNAW", "B00005JKFR", "B0045HCJSA", "B00009NHC0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 106455}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.45, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0792838416", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41y7q27x8nL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"}
{"description": "MGM's bold idea to remake George Cukor's Oscar-winning upperclass romantic farce,The Philadelphia Story, into a star-studded, Technicolor musical with Cole Porter tunes somehow works splendidly and remains an underrated gem. Even the plot and character names--and some bits of dialogue--all remain the same as the original. Crooning Bing Crosby replaces Cary Grant as the wealthy ex-husband trying to win back his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife, spoiled ice queen Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly, stunning and aloof in her last film role, originated in the earlier comedy by Katherine Hepburn). Unlike Grant, however, Crosby has jazz great Louis Armstrong, playing himself, in his corner for quixotic persuasion. Frank Sinatra (cocky in James Stewart's former role) and Celeste Holm add support as the nosy reporters covering, and subsequently complicating, the upcoming wedding. Sure,High Societylacks the original's witty satire, sarcasm, and character complexity; but it's assuredly paced and wonderfully acted, and contains enough romantic chemistry to keep the plot engaging. And then there's the music. Unlike the grandiose production numbers of many '40s and '50s musicals,High Society's musical sequences are considerably low-key and intimate, focusing on Porter's lyrical content, and the style in which it's delivered by the charismatic performers. Armstrong kicks the film off in telling style: he sings the title track, a calypso tune outlining the plot like a Greek chorus, not as an elaborately choreographed song-and-dance number, but instead stuffed claustrophobically in the back of a limousine with his jazz band. Other musical standouts include Sinatra and Crosby playfully tossing barbs during \"Well, Did You Evah?\"; Crosby and Armstrong teaming up for an energetic clash of styles in \"Now You Has Jazz\"; the two soaring, archetypal ballads by the leads--Crosby's \"I Love You, Samantha\" and Sinatra's superior \"You're Sensational\"; and, finally, the satirical Sinatra/Holm duet, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,\" the closestHigh Societyever comes to social or class commentary.--Dave McCoy", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302363292", "0792840836", "0792840844", "0792837630", "6300215660", "6303494390", "B00004RV8M", "6300183513", "6300215741", "6303444202", "630197736X", "6300183580", "6305282927", "B0000040EO", "0783221347", "630150528X", "155880997X", "0782006809", "6301586026", "B00000F6D1", "B00004TRD5", "630233683X", "0782006779", "6302227127", "0790744759", "0792839846", "6301670140", "6302484391", "6300215695", "6303209890", "0792840860", "6300181529", "B00005LMA7", "6303394019", "B000056BRF", "6301278410", "B000EW1RBA", "0800100832", "6300251152", "6301964012", "0782008348", "630266232X", "1558807780", "0783235593", "6303333079", "630290899X", "B00003OSTO"], "bought_together": ["6302363292", "0792840844"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 285126}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.99, "brand": "", "asin": "0792837649", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DXMQJX2DL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "High Society [VHS]"}
{"description": "David Lynch peeks behind the picket fences of small-town America to reveal a corrupt shadow world of malevolence, sadism, and madness. From the opening shots Lynch turns the Technicolor picture postcard images of middle class homes and tree-lined lanes into a dreamy vision on the edge of nightmare. After his father collapses in a preternaturally eerie sequence, college boy Kyle MacLachlan returns home and stumbles across a severed human ear in a vacant lot. With the help of sweetly innocent high school girl (Laura Dern), he turns junior detective and uncovers a frightening yet darkly compelling world of voyeurism and sex. Drawn deeper into the brutal world of drug dealer and blackmailer Frank, played with raving mania by an obscenity-shouting Dennis Hopper in a career-reviving performance, he loses his innocence and his moral bearings when confronted with pure, unexplainable evil. Isabella Rossellini is terrifyingly desperate as Hopper's sexual slave who becomes MacLachlan's illicit lover, and Dean Stockwell purrs through his role as Hopper's oh-so-suave buddy. Lynch strips his surreally mundane sets to a ghostly austerity, which composer Angelo Badalamenti encourages with the smooth, spooky strains of a lush score.Blue Velvetis a disturbing film that delves into the darkest reaches of psycho-sexual brutality and simply isn't for everyone.

{"description": "Perhaps best known for its faux Springsteen soundtrack, the 1983Eddie and the Cruisersis a rock lover's fantasy run wild. The story finds a reporter (Ellen Barkin) tracking down rumors of an unreleased album by a band whose charismatic leader (Michael Par&eacute;) allegedly died years before. As she approaches surviving members--who have since gone on to other things--she gets different points of view on Eddie's life and artistic drive, and the mystery about that album deepens. The trouble with the film is simple: it's impossible to accept. Michael Par&eacute; is far from suitable to play a Jersey shore rocker with thematic pretensions toward Rimbaud that go back to the '60s, and the soundtrack by John Cafferty sounds like a hack's rendition of E Street Band magic.

{"description": "Jean-Claude Van Damme, a.k.a. \"the Muscles from Brussels,\" had only a few movies to his credit when he played the hero in this lame postapocalyptic action flick from 1989. It's really just another martial-arts movie, dressed down with near-future trash and dirty sets that have \"low budget\" written all over them. Van Damme plays the protective escort for a half-human, half-cyborg woman whose programming contains a possible cure for a plague that's threatening to wipe out the entire population of Earth. But the woman is kidnapped by Van Damme's evil nemesis (is there any other kind?) while they are en route to her Atlanta headquarters. That leads Van Damme right into a lion's den of sadomasochistic torture and torment. If you've made it this far (and if you have, why?), you're probably a founding member of the Jean-Claude Van Damme fan club. To everyone else: Don't say you weren't warned--this is the kind of movie in which naming characters after electric guitars (Van Damme's character is named \"Gibson Rickenbacker\") qualifies as clever screenwriting.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002S94CK", "0783114885", "B0000542CD", "B00441GYY2", "0783228465", "B00006RCOC", "B0000542CC", "B000GRUMSC", "0767804252", "076780970X", "B001M9ELQC", "6305259429", "B001T21R5U", "B00596WEVI", "B0087OULG4", "0783227892", "0783225520", "6305551235", "B00005N5QW", "B001L2ZSJO", "B0099KJFJ4", "B0011VIO46", "0783226748", "B000022TSJ", "B00A34LX9A", "B002TVQ4CG", "B0006JGIQU", "B0043EFAJK", "B000N3T0E6", "B00HVFA2VE", "B002U6CJCO", "B0002848WQ", "B001PWY4NG", "0767821548", "B0002J58HO", "B001FWRYYC", "B0015FQZIK", "B006A8XFUI", "B0045HCJG2", "B0041QSZLA", "B00HODLW6C", "B000QXDCLU", "B001B3LIOC", "B005HIBWUW", "0783219660", "B00AKGG828", "B000GDH9IW", "B00J5LXT6M", "B000RW3VCK", "6305767866", "B00GB0OVY4", "1558908846", "B00AEFYDM2", "0790729334", "B0001Z37HM", "B0021FP3EA", "B00070FX5U", "B0050MB5NO", "B00J5G1P2W", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B0001VTPW2", "0767802454", "B00005O5B5", "B0002O7XUE", "B00005V4XK", "B00005JA8B", "B008XAT1HM", "B001W72VPW", "B00069L0Y0", "B000LC4Z7Q", "0767817745", "B00004STDN", "B00DYXCHN8", "B00009MEBX", "B00005JP3R", "B00CPKZLUC", "B0004Z33F0", "B00005N89J", "B0045HCIWW", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B000A2IPQY", "B00FEHCPZ2", "B000MEYKEG", "B000E8QVCO", "B0015XHP2C", "6305245487", "B00GDDNFDW", "B002ZG98LO", "B00005OOQ1", "B00004Y87O", "6304712499", "B0030BOCL4", "B004SIP6WW", "B002SG7Z7A", "B002E2QH8Q", "B00AEFXPMG", "B001T21R50", "B0045HCJT4", "6305428158", "B00AEFYXQI"], "bought_together": ["B00006RCOC", "0783228465"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003R3JNTQ", "0783114885", "B008NP4ZUU", "B0002S94CK"]}, "price": 17.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 124727}, "asin": "0792835735", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MTZXM0F2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Cyborg"}
{"description": "InThe Bad and the Beautiful, Kirk Douglas plays a tyrannical, manipulative producer fallen on hard times. To get back on his feet, he asks for help from three Hollywood giants whose careers he helped launch--a director (Barry Sullivan), an actress (Lana Turner), and a writer (Dick Powell). Unfortunately, they all hate him. Flashbacks explain why. Douglas had been close to all three at different points in his career: He and the director started out together making B-movies, he gave the wayward actress her first starring role, he turned the novelist into a successful screenwriter.  Then in one way or another he stabbed each of them in the back, though not always deliberately. The script has a lot of backstage  clich&eacute;s, but Vincente Minnelli's sharp, energetic direction, the gorgeous black-and-white  cinematography, and the topnotch performances--particularly Douglas and Gloria Grahame, who won an Oscar for her sweet role as the writer's cheerful Southern wife--flesh out the clich&eacute;s with cutting details and convincing bile.

{"description": "Pop star Frankie Avalon and former Mouseketeer Annette Funicello  inaugurated the beach movie proper (after Gidget tested the waters) with this  celebration of surf, sand, rock & roll music, and, of course, sex.

The film is entirely about Ruettiger's ceaseless if sometimes wavering commitment toward that goal, despite tremendous obstacles in physical stature, education requirements, the dismissiveness of coaches, poverty, his father's envy, and endless delays of one kind or another. This is the sort of film that looks back on a life and says the battle was its own reward, not the glory.

Oldman does well by the monster, even if he doesn't register much personality in the process, and Anthony Hopkins is a little overachieving as the vampire killer Van Helsing. The rest of the cast is serviceable, except Keanu Reeves, who--not atypically--is wooden and somehow empty.

This is one of Cruise's best, most underrated performances, and in an Oscar-winning role, Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the football star who remains Jerry Maguire's only loyal client on a hard road to redemption and personal growth. If that sounds touchy-feely, it is only because Crowe has combined sharp entertainment with a depth of character that is rarely found in mainstream comedy.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000065V3G", "B0000YEEGM", "B000GAKDAG", "0767811100", "B0018QPPXW", "B0002WZTOI", "B00005B6JZ", "B00AEFXR1K", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00AEBB9WI", "0783226810", "B00081U7HC", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEFXYJA", "B000XJD33O", "B00AEBB9LO", "B000G6BLHY", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000023VTP", "B004SEUJK0", "B00158K0QU", "B000MNOX94", "B00AEFXESQ", "B001ECDVK4", "B000957O82", "B0000DIXDR", "0780631536", "0783225733", "B00004W221", "B000EGDB10", "B0010YSD8Q", "B000056VP4", "630471193X", "B00005JG6N", "B000P0J0EW", "B00005JL78", "0800141806", "B00005JKG9", "0790730979", "B002VECM6S", "B0000AOV4I", "B000CCBCAS", "B000HRMAPE", "B0006GANPA", "6305236569", "B00005O5CM", "B00011CZRE", "B0038Z5T4Q", "B000053VB4", "B003ASLJQS", "B0000524E4", "B00AEFXE9U", "B00006ZXSL", "078324021X", "B000765IJK", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBB8NS", "B0002V7ON8", "B00015YVDG", "B002AT8KD8", "B007SPPANM", "0783233477", "B000035Z5G", "B007STBUHI", "B004SIP9U6", "B000E5N684", "B00AEFXYOA", "B001LGXIA6", "B002GOAGZC", "B000FI8MPW", "B002O3Z510", "B000N6U0E2", "B000069HZP", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000068NNU", "B00001ZWUS", "B004AOECXI", "B00AEFXN9G", "B000YDBPAM", "B002ZG9864", "B003QO8TOQ", "0792843592", "B0013FCWUW", "B000P0J0EM", "B000QQLVPQ", "B000HEWEE4", "B0001AVZA8", "B00000G3PA", "B000XT1P3E", "B0006N2EZ0", "B00008G8LM", "B00005JNTI", "6304765266", "B00AEFXT1S", "B003UESJHO", "B00004WG2F", "B00005T7HW", "B004L3AR0K", "6305128952"], "bought_together": ["B0002WZTOI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001680M26", "B0002WZTOI", "0792838467", "B000065V3G"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 8726}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "0800141741", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KBVJ813VL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jerry Maguire"}

Plagued by reckless leaps of logic, the movie starts with adequately eerie atmosphere and a perversely twisted performance byScream 2's Liev Schreiber, but decays into a familiar hash of gross-out effects, resulting from the annihilation of a small Colorado town by an evil force known as \"The Ancient Enemy.\" In a dreary role that insults the twilight of his distinguished career, Peter O'Toole plays a paleobiologist whose crackpot ideas have become tabloid fodder, but he holds the key to conquering the beast. Or does he?

{"description": "Judge Dreddis one of those movies that doesn't have a brain of its own, so it can only rip off a lot of ingredients from other, better movies. It's a mishmash ofBlade Runner,Total Recall, andThe Road Warrior, with a dash ofStar Warstossed in for good measure. As if that weren't enough, it's got Sylvester Stallone, who seems to be the only one in the movie who's in on the game and knows it's all a sci-fi scam. LikeThe Fifth Elementa few years later,Judge Dredddepicts a futuristic megalopolis packed with crowded vertical overgrowth and rampant commerce, where anarchy reigns supreme. Violent \"block wars\" are fought by lawless citizens with machine guns, and Judge Dredd (Stallone) is one of the city's heavily armed policemen, given free rein to judge and execute the perpetrators of violence. But Dredd himself is subjected to judgment and swift justice when his own gun is identified in the murder of a prominent TV reporter, forcing him to do whatever he can to clear his name.

{"description": "Criterion's release of Martin Scorsese'sThe Last Temptation of Christeffectively presents both the film's beauty and controversy. Produced on an extremely tight budget,The Last Temptation of Christhas a very epic feel that is wonderfully captured on this DVD. Though a few specks and scratches are apparent throughout the 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, the overall visual quality is quite sharp and vibrant. The newly mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 track is a phenomenal improvement, noticeably enhancing ambient sounds, dialogue, and Peter Gabriel's moving soundtrack. There are various added extras that really put the f'lm&#x92;s content into perspective.  The stellar commentary track includes director Martin Scorsese, star Willem Dafoe, screenwriter Paul Schrader, and film critic Jay Cocks candidly discussing various aspects of the production, including the initial obstacles, extensive research, and notorious controversial elements.  This is a great DVD for fans and an informative one for those who wish to see past its notoriety.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00028HBKM", "B001BSBBIU", "B00006RCNV", "B002AT8KBU", "068485256X", "B0000633QW", "B000CZ0O54", "B0002BO05S", "B000WC39ZY", "B002Z2X7GK", "B000286RNE", "B00028HBIO", "B00005JNGA", "B000286RPM", "B004499LWG", "B00BTYMPX6", "B00005UM2Y", "0767827929", "B000A2UBN4", "B000035Z5G", "6305090580", "B0006Q93ZG", "B0006GAOJA", "B001NSLE5I", "B003ZZAXEK", "B001BEK8E2", "B0057GYODG", "B0001XALGY", "B000VE439Y", "B00005QAPH", "0783225903", "B000286RO8", "B00008WJD9", "B003NXH2TS", "B00007AJF8", "B000LP6KNU", "B00005AUKD", "B005KQVE1S", "B00AEBBACM", "B000067IZ3", "B001WLMOL4", "B003KGBISE", "B004VJJF34", "B00L3PA8P8", "B00062IVL2", "B00007CVS2", "B00005UQ7T", "B000286RR0", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B00005V1WY", "B000286RP2", "B00AEBB8NI", "B00339VUYU", "B002U6DVPS", "B00080ZG10", "B00000F3CD", "B00AEFY9RG", "B001IHJ988", "B000G8NXYG", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00014K5V4", "B0007M2234", "B0002KQNKE", "0780022343", "B0057GYOBI", "B0024EWP6W", "B00ICWO144", "B0050FXDDQ", "0783229526", "B00HFWETSA", "B000MGB6NM", "B000TXNDV6", "B00000CQJZ", "B003UM8T3A", "B00AEFXQ9S", "B00H9L28OO", "B00HRYH6GI", "B001JNNDGA", "B000C20VPA", "B000063JDE", "B006TTC5A4", "B00H9KKGTO", "B0002KPHZG", "B00000IQC0", "B0014FAIZC", "B001EOQCMG", "B00ALTQRUC", "0670038458", "B000056NX5", "B00005JN8Z", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767830555", "B000F7CEC0", "B004WPYO7E", "B00H9HZITU", "B0009298N4", "B0047P5FU4", "0025419498", "B000P0J09M", "B003LR5BD0"], "bought_together": ["B00028HBKM", "B0000633QW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00028HBKM", "B0000633QW", "B0002BO05S", "B002AT8KBU"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 76534}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.99, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "1559409037", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517ZJYRYZ7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Last Temptation of Christ (The Criterion Collection)"}

A vaudeville act featuring \"Tax Man Max\" looks at government spending, then \"Walkin' on Wall Street\" takes a jazzy glimpse of the stock market. The historical development of bartering and its modern applications supply the thematic material of \"This for That,\" a hungry dinosaur in \"Tyrannosaurus Debt\" personifies our national debt, and the complicated process initiated by the simple writing of a check is broken down in \"The Check's in the Mail.\" If all this sounds potentially dry, even mind-numbing, recall how the potentially dull subject of grammar sprang to life with similar treatment inGrammar Rock.

Soderbergh himself stars as two people--one an ineffective dentist, the other a speechwriter for a cult movement called Eventualism, which has set out to \"question all answers\"--connected by their romances with the same woman, played by Soderbergh's real-life ex, Betsy Bramley. There isn't so much a story as a series of bits in which these characters often (though not necessarily) turn up, from press conferences on the subject of horse urination to old footage of nudists to a scene of an Eventualist exchange between husband and wife: \"Generic greeting!\" \"Generic greeting returned!\" None of this leads to a literal point, but after a while an undercurrent of disease about making sense of the modern world becomes apparent beneath the jokes. Soderbergh (sex, lies, and videotape,Out of Sight) is certainly a filmmaker who goes his own way in life, always hitting his target in one spot or another and occasionally getting a bull's-eye for his trouble.Schizopolisis no bull's-eye, and it has just as many detractors as admirers, but it's impossible not to appreciate Soderbergh's conviction that making a film out on the fringes is a worthy endeavor.--Tom Keogh", "price": 19.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 581785}, "asin": "1572521481", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RK6ZGMACL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Schizopolis [VHS]"}
{"description": "Costa-Gavras'sZ, winner of the 1970 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, is a classic political thriller, combining intrigue with raw emotional power. The story turns on the investigation of the assassination of a left-wing Greek politician (Yves Montand), and his government's attempts to cover up the murky circumstances. Montand receives death threats as he prepares to give a speech condemning the government, and is then run down in front of numerous witnesses. Jean-Louis Trintignant (The Conformist) plays the judge assigned to the investigation, who gradually discovers how far the state will go to rid itself of political opposition. As he is warned off the case by his superiors, the judge becomes even more determined to discover the truth, no matter where it might lead. Costa-Gavras (Missing,Mad City) is in familiar territory here, but no one handles this type of material better.Zis a classic of political intrigue and social consciousness.--Robert Lane", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 399575}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.76, "brand": "", "asin": "1572521163", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R1GYXF6FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Z [VHS]"}
{"description": "Abrasive, self-deluded humor tinges the prickly exploration of sexual politics in French director Eric Rohmer's world and it often makes for less-than-comfortable viewing. Though Rohmer has made movies for several decades, his best-known films comprise a cycle loosely dubbed \"The Six Moral Tales\" (one short, one featurette, and four features), which also includesLa Collectionneuse,My Night at Maud's, andChloe in the Afternoon. Rohmer's comedies are full of the disillusion and jaded settling that come with age and adulthood, and he sharply contrasts cynicism against the naivet&eacute; and  easy, innocent wisdom of youth. InClaire's Knee, Jean-Claude Brialy plays a diplomat named Jerome Montcharvin, who agrees to housesit a friend's rural but lavish country estate for a month. Jerome appears contented with life as he's recently become engaged to Lucinde, a woman he's known for six years. He takes refuge in the fact that she is his opposite, and placates his doubts by reminding himself that \"a woman made for me would bore me.\" Into this summer idyll and Jerome's predictable, ordered life come two teenage girls who threaten his faithful but passionless ardor for his fianc&eacute;e. To temper  his awakening libido, Jerome pretends to \"experiment\" with the young women's affections and, in doing so, exposes himself as a cruel, callous man who is clueless as to his true nature. Though a close woman friend cautions him that \"in love, there is will,\" he dismisses the possibility yet in the end performs an act of \"pure will\" with one of the teens, the lovely Claire, and brashly hurts that which he most desires.Claire's Kneewas shot by the brilliant cinematographer, the late Nestor Almendros, and the color palette in the film is a masterpiece of style and scheme. It's a Monet on celluloid, and its visual prowess, combined with the provocative, unsettling theme, earned the National Society of Film Critics' Best Film prize in 1971. (Unfortunately,  the first \"reel\" of the DVD transfer contains several noticeable scratches and the color is also faded and purple.)--Paula Nechak", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572522127", "B003VA3JTA", "B005KQVE1S", "B00004Z1FM", "B00ATK02FO", "B002IVDLH8", "1572525428", "B00005UJY6", "B0038SUB1O", "B000087EY6", "B000056EWF", "157252541X", "B005J7K9AA", "B00004U0FL", "1572522135", "B00019JR6I", "B00000IBQ1", "B00000JJHL"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FUF7CQ", "B00005UJY6"]}, "price": 63.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 64493}, "asin": "1572522445", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RWJZ3PD1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Claire's Knee"}

Bonus materials include a documentary on the making of the film, which was directed by Penelope Spheeris; another &#34;Videozone&#34; featurette on the movie; a music video for the song &#34;Pain&#34;; a coming attractions short for Blood Dolls, as well as trailers for forty other titles from Full Moon Productions; and a chapter of bloopers and outtakes. From All Movie Guide: Another gimmick-driven Full Moon Pictures production, though this time the ratio of comedy-to-gore is better balanced and there's enough goofy ideas on display for three films. We get a malevolent pinheaded billionaire, a captive all-girl rock band, a one-eyed dwarf in a tuxedo, a sado-masochistic industrialist, and a clown-faced, snaggletoothed henchman named &#34;Mr. Mascero.&#34; That list doesn't even include the titular puppets, a trio of racially exaggerated dolls that do their creator's sinister bidding. It's all astoundingly ridiculous and played with straight faces and majestic overacting, making Blood Dolls a lightweight but enjoyable thrill ride. Director and screenwriter Charles Band lets the plot veer crazily from science fiction to horror to rock video to love story, and even tacks on a William Castle-style alternate ending for the hell of it. Blood Dolls was originally planned in conjunction with music magnate Miles Copeland, and was to be hyped with a soundtrack album and concert tour for the sexy girl rockers who appear as secondary characters in the film. Various difficulties caused this plan to collapse, which is fortunate, since not only were these actresses unable to play their instruments, but the music they were given to mime is wretched, uninspired goth rock nonsense. Anyone familiar with Band's lengthy track record will be reminded of his Puppet Master series and its similar &#34;killer toy&#34; motif. Is it unfair to suspect that Blood Dolls is just an elaborate advertisement for the &#34;collectible&#34; action figures that Full Moon Pictures had planned for sale before the film's release (casually mentioned by Band on the DVD's commentary track)? Probably not. Still, as crass merchandising franchises go, it's one of the best that this low-rent production house has in its bulky, inconsistent oeuvre.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009B8YNGO", "B009TT07BK", "B00ARWWYX2", "B00D9EJFRS", "B008YAPR7E", "B0002S9QUA", "6305337322", "157347049X", "B00DOZNGTK", "B00001U0I4", "B00ARWWTDM", "B000ZYIRBK", "B009TT041I", "B009EUVXZI", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B0000V48GG", "B00009PY4C", "B0042FDCKY", "1573470988", "B000A6T20I", "B00ARWWV58", "B0031Y800O", "B0001ZX0GU", "B008MTZR9K", "0783227434", "1573471879", "B005CFBZ8O", "B00009MGEM", "B000NNDCS6", "1573470473", "B0091G7BTM", "B004BR7XJ4", "B002L5GQ64", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0011POHMK", "B001D5C1OO", "B00ARWXATE", "B00AGKH4MG", "B000BGR0UG", "B006LOBZXK", "B00012FX6I", "B005IGVTHY", "B0055SJY2W", "B005J9ZFQG", "B0006LB5AC", "B00006IUFV", "B003VMFWXO", "B009TT07K6", "B00A429Y56", "B005B0QYTU", "B00BDZV54Q", "B0002C9DK4", "B00CERJINC", "B009TT04UO", "B004VLLWCE", "B007N0RECC", "B000BO0KOQ", "B0053TWV5K", "B0026VBOOW", "B003HFUVQI", "B003HI3B30", "B00977HRSK", "B00000IBRJ", "B0051GLDQS", "B000K3QONE", "B000K6ODAW", "B000MVHPLY", "B00009MEGA", "B000U1ZVDK", "B000056AYK", "B004QCZOX6", "B007C3TVCQ", "B006J6CDQI", "B00006ADD9", "B000Q66FHK", "B00CHRBADK", "B008MK7D0U", "B0016MJ6KG", "B0007WQHHQ", "B003ZZ2URI", "B008NM63Q2", "B00009L4TW", "B00080Z548", "B00009W0WC", "B00926DPNW", "B00009XN7X", "B000O785ZQ", "1573471399", "B009DA73IK", "B000TXNDRU", "6305078580", "B0002VEWR4", "B00076MXMU", "B000K6MDGS", "B003R9K0GU", "B000A35PRK", "B000A395NU", "B0001FGBTS", "B000068TP7"], "bought_together": ["B009B8YNGO", "B00D9EJFRS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009B8YNGO", "6305337322", "B0042FDCKY", "B003HI3B30"]}, "price": 16.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 253208}, "asin": "1573471070", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71KQ84HJMNL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Blood Dolls"}

Jonathan (Nicholson) and Sandy (Garfunkel) are college roommates who share an endless fascination and obsession with women. As time goes by, their relentless pursuit for the joys of the flesh becomes more competitive...and more damaging. Soon, Jonathan and Sandy's lives become a vicious circle of girls, booze and unfulfillment, and they realize only too late that in the war of the sexes they are their own worst enemy. *1997: Actor, As Good As It Gets; 1983: Supporting Actor, Terms of Endearment; 1975: Actor, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00001W9G0", "6300251098", "6302757096", "0800100832", "6300216047", "6303269834", "B00004W46N", "6301766261", "B0079R1LNM"], "also_viewed": ["B00AQ5W444"]}, "price": 9.25, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 284526}, "asin": "6300147355", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/2142C2MDFCL.jpg", "title": "Carnal Knowledge [VHS]"}

{"description": "This is the TV movie that put Steven Spielberg on the map, shortly before he madeThe Sugarland Express. Working from a script by Richard Matheson, the film stars Dennis Weaver as a mild-mannered traveling salesman who unintentionally angers the driver of a semi truck. Suddenly, the truck is not only riding his tail but trying to run him off the road. No matter what he does (pulling over, stopping at a diner, calling the cops), he can't get rid of it. Spielberg makes the wise decision of never showing the driver, even as he cranks the voltage on the film's suspense elements. As a result, the truck itself takes on an air of satanic menace--even a personality of sorts--as it seems to hunt its human prey. Spielberg made a lot out of a little, suggesting just how skilled a storyteller he would become.--Marshall Fine", "related": {"also_bought": ["0764006770", "B0013527K2", "630197705X", "0792835077", "630180550X", "6301976061", "0792846443", "B00AEFXX9Q", "6305123616", "6300214060", "B004IB04NK", "6300213838", "6303471552", "6302890721", "6303148352", "B0000068EE", "6301969413", "6304071876", "6302038308", "0790733897", "0790734079", "6302516919", "6300213900", "6300181340", "0783231482", "6300181286", "0783235607", "6304005512"], "bought_together": ["B0013527K2"], "also_viewed": ["B0013527K2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 250761}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.88, "brand": "", "asin": "6300181987", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FN746KT0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Duel [VHS]"}

The plot finds a New York gang having to cross the territory of rivals in order to get to their own 'hood. A sort of urban Western with a comic-book pace, artificial colors, fable-like tone, and broad acting, the film isn't intended to steep us in gritty realities so much as spin a decadent fantasy out of them.

{"description": "You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film,Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, and though it left the Oscar race empty-handed, its dramatic power and handsome yet haunting imagery remain just as strong today.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303402070", "6304119046", "6300147630", "6300214443", "6300182770", "B0009RRUKW", "6303018351", "6302250269", "6303515304", "6304510861"], "bought_together": ["B0009RRUKW", "6303018351"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 291258}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 6.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6300214044", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WWCSWM4ML.jpg", "title": "The Elephant Man [VHS]"}
{"description": "This splatter flick, along with John Carpenter'sHalloween, helped spawn the great horror-movie movement of the '80s, not to mentioneightsequels, many of which had nothing to do with the films that preceded them. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, one of the three biggest horror-movie psychos of the modern era (the other two beingHalloween's Michael Myers andA Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger). Forever duplicated, the originalFriday the 13thpopularized a number of themes and techniques that today are now clich&eacute;s: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die, very painfully. Still, if you have to see aFriday the 13thmovie, this is the one to check out. A group of eager (and horny) teenagers decide to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which 20 years earlier was closed after the shocking and mysterious murders of two amorous camp counselors. You can take it from there, as the teens get picked off one by one, during a dark and stormy night; of course, their car won't start and there's no phone. The ending stole shamelessly from Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but it still provides a slight if campy shock. Look for a young Kevin Bacon as the requisite stud--you can tell that's what he is because when the cast appears in swimsuits, he's wearing a Speedo--who's the beneficiary of the film's best murder sequence, an arrowhead to the throat.

As a satire of the media's intrusion into our lives, it would make an ideal double-feature withThe Truman Show.Brooks stars as himself, a comedian who, he states, would have been a scientist had he \"studied harder or been graded more fairly.\" Though obliviously unqualified, he is spearheading a project that endeavors to capture a year in the life of a typical American family.Charles Grodin stars as put-upon Warren Yeager, the Phoenix, Arizona,  veterinarian who watches helplessly as the callous Brooks overwhelms his life.

{"description": "\"I'm not a drinker--I'm a drunk.\" These words, and the serious message behind them, were still potent enough in 1945 to shock audiences flocking toThe Lost Weekend. The speaker is Don Birnam (Ray Milland), a handsome, talented, articulate alcoholic. The writing team of producer Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder pull no punches in their depiction of Birnam's massive weekend bender, a tailspin that finds him reeling from his favorite watering hole to Bellevue Hospital. Location shooting in New York helps the street-level atmosphere, especially a sequence in which Birnam, a budding writer, tries to hock his typewriter for booze money. He desperately staggers past shuttered storefronts--it's Yom Kippur, and the pawnshops are closed. Milland, previously known as a lightweight leading man (he'd starred in Wilder's hilariousThe Major and the Minorthree years earlier), burrows convincingly under the skin of the character, whether waxing poetic about the escape of drinking or screaming his lungs out in the D.T.'s sequence. Wilder, having just made the ultra-noirDouble Indemnity, brought a new kind of frankness and darkness to Hollywood's treatment of a social problem. At first the film may have seemed too bold; Paramount Pictures nearly killed the release of the picture after it tested poorly with preview audiences.

Besieged by people eager to work with him, however, he also struggles to find his next idea for a film. The combined pressures draw him within himself, where his recollections of significant events in his life and the many lovers he has left behind begin to haunt him. The marriage of Fellini's hyperreal imagery, dreamy sidebars, and the gravity of Guido's increasing guilt and self-awareness make this as much a deeply moving, soulful film as it is an electrifying spectacle.

It's one of the most unusual black comedies ever made, simply because it stretches a simple premise over 130 minutes of straight-faced, strangely compelling commentary on politics, media, and celebrity in media-savvy America. Adapted by Jerzy Kozinsky from his own novel, the movie's about a simple-minded, middle-aged gardener who, after a lifetime of seclusion and safety in a Washington, D.C. townhouse, gets his first exposure to reality beyond the walls of his sheltered existence. His only reference to the world is through his childlike addiction to television, and when a chance encounter brings him into the inner fold of a dying billionaire (Melvyn Douglas), he suddenly finds himself the toast of Washington's political elite. His simple phrases about gardening are misinterpreted as anything from economic predictions to sage political advice, and under the sharp direction of Hal Ashby, Sellers has the audacity to take this comedic conceit to its logical extreme.Being Thereis not for all tastes--especially not for those who don't appreciate comedic subtlety.

{"description": "The second--and most horrifying--of the fivePlanet of the Apesmovies, this film goes where few end-of-the-world movies ever dare tread. It's the far future. The mass of humanity has descended into speechless savagery, kept as captive animals by the talking apes who have inherited the world. Two astronauts from our time have landed here, retracing the path of their lost comrade, Captain Taylor (Charlton Heston). Unfortunately, they've landed in the middle of a grim situation. Warlike gorillas are preparing to eliminate the last shards of shattered human civilization, a degenerate, subterranean cult worshipping the greatest of all human achievements--the cobalt bomb. As well as rescuing Taylor, the two men have to stop the gorillas from wiping out humanity ... and stop humanity from fulfilling their self-appointed, self-destructive destiny. This is both thrill-a-minute science fiction and a surprisingly deep reflection on the human condition. Plus, it's got lots of guys in really keen ape suits.--Grant Balfour", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301661761", "B000E6ESEO", "B00004ZBGC", "6301661729", "6302814723", "0790733897", "B000E6ESDU"], "bought_together": ["6301661761"], "also_viewed": ["6301661729", "B005FHWWXQ", "B000E6ESEO", "6305076146", "B00004ZBGJ", "B000E6ESE4", "6301661761", "B000K7VHHS"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270687}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6301661710", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71RGN33WHNL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Beneath the Planet of the Apes [VHS]"}
{"description": "Just as Roberto Benigni found himself on the receiving end of some finger-wagging for making a comedy set during the Holocaust, so the great Ernst Lubitsch caught some heat for this extraordinary 1942 satire set behind enemy lines during World War II. In his best performance on film, Jack Benny stars as Joseph Tura, the lead actor and head of a Polish theater troupe that is suddenly enlisted as a Resistance organization when an American pilot (Robert Stack) requires protection. The twist is that the pilot has been having a series of trysts with Tura's wife (Carole Lombard), the hilarious evidence being the disruptive departure of Stack's character from a theater audience each night as the hammy Tura unknowingly cues the lovers by launching into Hamlet's famous soliloquy. The remarkable script by Edwin Justus Mayer ingeniously folds the tensions of a betrayed marriage into the comic suspense surrounding Tura and company's efforts to pull off aMission: Impossible-like sting on the local Nazi command. Many unforgettable moments and lines of dialogue adorn this black comedy, and the performances--most memorably Sig Ruman's crisp volleys with Benny--are a dream. Above it all, however, is Lubitsch's unmistakable Continentalism, his accent on Old World manners especially in a dangerous situation, suggesting the Nazis' very vulgarity was a reflection of their profound evil.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302226899"], "also_viewed": ["B00CUKTGSA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 308722}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630170648X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ER4GRW8WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "To Be Or Not to Be [VHS]"}

She's also a great athletic competitor, except when her overbearing, worrywart fianc&eacute;, Collier Weld, is around. (As Weld, William Ching does an admirable job in a thankless role.) All Pat has to do is see Collier's face on the sidelines and her golf swing loses its power; her tennis game goes haywire. It takes crooked sports manager Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy, of course) to recognize Pat's outstanding talent. He takes her on as his most important client and handles her with the same loving care that he gives to his favorite racehorse. Naturally, Pat and Mike's relationship is destined to overstep its professional boundaries. The mutual attraction grows from the moment they meet. Watching Pat walk away, Mike comments to his partner, \"Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce'.\"The film carries a powerful feminist message, especially considering that it was made in the early 1950s: Pat is undone by Collier, who would rather have her stick to being \"the little woman\" and forget about succeeding. But with Mike in her corner, Pat can have a great career. Her union with him is a true partnership; everything is, as he says, \"Five-oh, five-oh.\" In the end, he's secure enough to be comfortable as \"the man behind the woman.\" The film features terrific comic performances by Aldo Ray as a bone-headed boxer, a young Charles Bronson (before he changed his name from Buchinski) as a small-time gangster, andOur Gang's Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer as a high-strung bus boy.--Laura Mirsky", "related": {"also_bought": ["630290899X"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 486884}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.46, "brand": "", "asin": "6301973267", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VEAMXZPFL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pat &amp; Mike [VHS]"}

Grant is good as a bon vivant who had a way with words but lacked the discipline to pursue a career in law. As a singer, on the other hand, he's merely adequate. Curtiz wisely has the fine supporting actresses (Jane Wyman, Ginny Simms, etc.) handle the big numbers such  as \"You're the Top.\" Also, Porter's story was meant for black and white. The  Technicolor process adds an unfortunate garishness to the tale of a man whose  very name has become a synonym for elegance. With Mary Martin and Monty Woolley  as themselves.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "A hallmark of the science fiction genre as well as a wry commentary on the political climate of the 1950s,The Day the Earth Stood Stillis a sci-fi movie less concerned with special effects than with a social parable. A spacecraft lands in Washington, D.C., carrying a humanoid messenger from another world (Michael Rennie) imparting a warning to the people of Earth to cease their violent behavior. But panic ensues as the messenger lands and is shot by a nervous soldier. His large robot companion destroys the Capitol as the messenger escapes the confines of the hospital. He moves in with a family as a boarder and blends into society to observe the full range of the human experience. Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) not only provides one of the most recognizable icons of the science fiction world in his depiction of the massive robot loyal to his master, but he avoids the obvious camp elements of the story to create a quiet and observant story highlighting both the good and the bad in human nature.--Robert Lane", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HDNPM0", "6300215539", "6301327845", "6304507348", "6301977815", "6300208508", "6300181278", "0800132009", "6302120101", "6302797667", "6300181340", "6304233639", "6300183513", "0790743213", "6300181286", "6300183580", "6300269566", "6300183084", "0783235593", "0783221347", "6302884705", "0783235607", "6302763835", "0783236352", "630442972X", "6300215644", "0800116917", "0790752395", "0790743159", "6300182533", "630266232X", "6300269477", "6302605164", "6300185974", "B00005B238", "0782008348"], "bought_together": ["6300215539"], "also_viewed": ["6300208508"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 312863}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.34, "brand": "", "asin": "6302168465", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QGHTN64FL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Day the Earth Stood Still [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Andrei Tarkovsky's second film, ANDREI RUBLEV, is a massive and sweeping retelling of the life of the 15th-century Russian icon painter and perhaps the first great Russian artist. Unfolding in a free-flowing series of eight episodes, ANDREI RUBLEV follows the painter (Anatoli Solonitsyn) as he faces unbearable violence, endless attacks by the crude and malicious Tartars, and, eventually, a crippling crisis of faith. A moving mosaic of time, spirituality, dreams, history, culture, and politics, Tarkovsky's masterpiece was immediately condemned by the Russian authorities, who waited five years before giving it an official release. Despite this, the film endures as a wrenching testament to Tarkovsky's unique vision of the power of art and the duty of the artist. The film follows Rublev as he traverses the wretched earth of Russia in the Middle Ages, encountering jesters, fools, other artists, and the masses who eventually restore his faith in life and art. Tarkovsky's signature elliptical style, matched with stunning cinematography and breathtaking (and often nonnarrative) editing, creates a film unlike any other. Neither strict biography nor historical epic, ANDREI RUBLEV is the visual depiction of the mystical capacity for art to transform the struggles and joys of the human into the divine.

{"description": "A married man, left alone during a hot summer, fantasizes madly about the impossibly gorgeous woman living in the upstairs apartment. When the woman is Marilyn Monroe, such fantasies are the stuff of epics, andThe Seven Year Itchis a memorable laugh machine. Tom Ewell, repeating his role from George Axelrod's Broadway hit, plays the itchy protagonist, whose vivid imagination gets the better of him. When Monroe finally comes downstairs and becomes friends (confiding, among other things, that she keeps her undies in the icebox in this hot weather), imagination meets reality in a merciless attack on the male libido. Ewell's crack timing is matched by Monroe's zesty comic flair, and the scene in which her white dress is blown skyward by a passing subway train has entered the encyclopedia of great movie images. Director Billy Wilder adapted the play with Axelrod; if the film is not one of Wilder's signature works (Some Like It HotandThe Apartmentwould soon follow), it is nevertheless a smoothly crafted comedy.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792837096", "6302484383", "6302484391", "B0000068ZQ", "6300269256", "6304056877", "6302484421", "B00000F13T", "630428635X", "6302305942", "6300213668", "6305123616", "6302842263", "0783235607", "0783235593", "6300215814", "6301734734", "B000005PPB", "0782008348", "6301798562", "6300183513", "6300267865", "6301797957", "6303333079"], "bought_together": ["0792837096", "6302484383"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 316658}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.93, "brand": "", "asin": "6302484405", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JVFJDFCQL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Seven Year Itch [VHS]"}

When Piccolo becomes stricken with cancer, his relentless will to live inspires the talented Sayers to reach his athletic potential.

{"description": "Gene Wilder takes his most unusual role, a naive 19th-century rabbi sent from his native Poland to the fledgling Jewish community in San Francisco, in this warm-hearted comic adventure. The trusting soul is easy prey for the con men and criminals who prey on the immigrants arriving in the Philadelphia port and the rabbi, beaten but unbowed, continues his trek West solo: broke, underequipped, and hopelessly lost. Harrison Ford, fresh fromStar Wars, is the roguish outlaw who adopts the determined traveler and the two become unlikely friends as they make their way through one scrape after another. Wilder makes a sincere and sympathetic hero, his faith and courage seeing him through one crisis after another, and fresh-faced Ford makes an endearing scamp of a bank robber. The meandering adventure, overlong at two hours, takes its time as the duo traverses the gorgeous American countryside and end up in the bustling Barbary Coast San Francisco of the Gold Rush era. Legendary hard-edged action director Robert Aldrich (Kiss Me Deadly,The Dirty Dozen) brings a gentle touch and easygoing humor to this family-oriented adventure, but old habits die hard.

{"description": "Consistently cited by critics worldwide as one of the greatest films ever made, Jean Renoir's bittersweet drama of life, love, class, and the social code of manners and behavior (\"the rules of the game\") is a savage critique undertaken with sensitivity and compassion. Renoir's catch-phrase through the film, \"Everyone has their reasons,\" develops a multilayered meaning by the conclusion. A young aviator (Roland Toutain) commits a serious social faux pas by alluding to an affair on national radio. To avert a scandal, the cultured Robert de la Chesnaye (Marcel Dalio), husband to the aviator's mistress, Christine (Nora Gregor), and a philanderer in his own right, invites all to a weekend hunting party in his country mansion. The complicated maze of marriages and mistresses (social register and servant class alike) is plotted like a bedroom farce, but the tone soon takes a darker cast. Renoir, who also takes the pivotal role as Andre's jovial pal and de la Chesnaye confidant Octave, deftly blends high comedy with cutting satire as he parallels the upstairs-downstairs affairs. The film builds to a comic pitch with the hilarious performance of Julien Carette as a rabbit poacher turned groundskeeper, but soon turns tragic in a devastating conclusion. The film was roundly condemned and banned in France upon its 1939 release, but years later (out of the shadow of WWII) the film was rediscovered for the masterpiece that it is.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 412283}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "The Rules of the Game [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["6304628188"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JT64E0AAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "6302969301"}

{"description": "The postwar vogue for documentary-style realism, prompted byThe March of Timeand the critical success of Roberto Rossellini'sOpen City, cross bred with film noir to create a compelling strain of crime films; this is one of the most low-key and credible, based on the true story of a Chicago reporter (James Stewart) who became convinced of the innocence of a death-row inmate (Richard Conte). Director Henry Hathaway (whoseKiss of Deathstarted the trend) stages the action on the actual Chicago locations, providing a fascinating documentary record of an underfilmed metropolis (the convict's mother is a washerwoman at the Wrigley Building), and leads his cast to appropriately restrained, naturalistic performances. Stewart is just beginning to explore his newfound, postwar maturity here, and there's an undercurrent of obsessiveness in his performance that anticipates the haunted figures he would soon be playing for Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock.--Dave Kehr", "related": {"also_bought": ["6302700949", "630345786X", "6301973410", "0792837371"]}, "price": 17.73, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 388547}, "asin": "6303102506", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FRZSC8B1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Call Northside 777 [VHS]"}
{"description": "Few actresses have captivated the camera as powerfully as Dorothy  Dandridge inCarmen Jones. Her polished beauty plays in irresistible contrast to her title character's leonine sexuality and fluid emotions; a man can't decide from moment to moment if he wants to save her from doom, build her a castle, or never let her out of bed. Of course, that's the problem with the boys in this semi-experimental adaptation of Bizet's opera,Carmen. Straight-arrow Joe (a strapping Harry Belafonte), an obedient corporal on a Southern military base during World War&nbsp;II, is all set to go to flight school and marry his hometown sweetie, Cindy Lou (Olga James), when his troublemaking sergeant orders him to accompany Carmen to a civilian court. In short order, Joe is swept up in Carmen's carnal anarchy and her craving for  release from lousy options in life. An impulsive act of violence ensures that Joe's future is gone forever, putting Carmen in the difficult position of destroying their relationship to save him. Oscar Hammerstein II took  Bizet's music in 1943 and rewrote the book and lyrics. The result is largely a smashing success with a few missteps (the bullfighter in Bizet's piece becomes a heavyweight boxer here, which breaks up a certain grace in the  story) and a couple of perfect stretches (the long prelude to Carmen and Joe's first embrace, set on Carmen's home turf). Despite the fact that both Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, their vocal performances were  dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson and Marilyn Horne. (Yes, it is a little disconcerting to hear another voice come out of the more familiar Belafonte's mouth.) Otto Preminger directed with his usual eye on economy of action and production, as the numerous musical numbers tend to be shot in lengthy, single,  carefully choreographed takes. The result can be a little visually static at times, but the passion behind the singing pulls everything through.--Tom  Keogh", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467747}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.65, "brand": "", "asin": "6303102425", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGP1S6K4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Carmen Jones [VHS]"}
{"description": "This is the movie that Leonardo DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for, five years beforeTitanic. And, in fact, this is the movie that should have made him a star, he's so good in it. Based on the novel by Peter Hedges (who adapted his own book) and directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m (My Life as a Dog), this is the funny, moody tale of a young man named Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) who lives at home in a small town with his 500-pound Momma (beautifully played by nonpro Darlene Cates), his mentally retarded younger brother Arnie (DiCaprio, utterly convincing), and his sisters. Not a lot happens--Arnie keeps climbing a water tower and getting stuck; Gilbert is involved with a married woman (Mary Steenburgen), then meets a nice new girl in town who's closer to his age (Juliette Lewis). And that's exactly what makes this movie so much more than your run-of-the-mill Hollywood product: it's not about some mechanical, formulaic plot; it's about these characters, and it allows you to spend some time with them and get to know them. Depp may have started out as a TV teen idol on21 Jump Street, but his feature film choices since then--in such wonderfully offbeat and diverse movies asCry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Benny & Joon,Donnie Brasco--have made him one of the most interesting, unpredictable, and risk-taking young actors in American movies.--Jim Emerson", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301763041", "630018403X"], "bought_together": ["6301763041"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 216191}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.79, "brand": "", "asin": "6303124798", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51APPGGETRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "What's Eating Gilbert Grape [VHS]"}

{"description": "Paul Newman shines as cocky poolroom hustler \"Fast\" Eddie Felson in Robert Rossen's atmospheric adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel. Newman's Felson is a swaggering pool shark punk who takes on the king of the poolroom, Minnesota Fats (a cool, assured Jackie Gleason in his most understated performance). After losing big and crashing into a void of self-pity, Eddie meets down-and-out Sarah (Piper Laurie in a delicate performance), an alcoholic blue blood who's dropped into Eddie's world of dingy bars and seedy poolrooms. Eddie regains his confidence and attracts the attention of a shifty, calculating promoter, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott at his most heartless), who offers to bring Eddie into the big money--but at what cost? Rossen brings his film to life with the easy pace of a pool game, giving his actors room to explore their characters and develop into a razor-sharp ensemble. Eugen Sch&uuml;fftan earned an Academy Award for his shadowing black-and-white cinematography, as did art directors Harry Horner and Gene Callahan for their deceivingly simple set designs. Even in the daylight this film seems to be smothered by night, lit by the dim glow of a bar lamp or the overhead glare of a pool-table light, an appropriate environment for this tale of one man's struggle with his soul and his self-esteem. Newman returned as an older, wiser, cagier Felson 25 years later in Martin Scorsese'sColor of Money.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00000I1DI", "630018627X", "B000035Z5G", "1569942072", "6302238331", "6301966066", "6300215962", "630018224X", "6301599225", "6300276740", "0790743531", "6300246965", "6303257739", "B00000FZCU", "6301863194"], "bought_together": ["B00000I1DI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 283771}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "", "asin": "630321245X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E8MNH1TWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hustler [VHS]"}

Unfortunately for Michael, Nicole doesn't like him very much and keeps rebuffing his advances, even though most women would be only too happy to marry him for his money. For just that reason, Nicole's father (Edward Everett Horton), a financially embarrassed French nobleman, strongly suggests that matrimony with Michael would be a good idea, especially since Michael doesn't want to take no for an answer. Nicole eventually relents and weds Michael, but when she tries to get him to change a few of his habits during the honeymoon, he makes plans to divorce her. But Nicole has finally decided that she loves Michael after all, and, as he tries to flee from her, she gives chase, determined to win his heart once and for all.", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301973380", "6304153104", "B000NIBUTE"], "bought_together": ["6304153104"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 320933}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.99, "brand": "", "asin": "6303382932", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5106NFJFXRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife [VHS]"}
{"description": "A perfect marriage of novel but incisive writing, acting, and direction,Bigis the story of a 12-year-old boy who wishes he were older, and wakes up one morning as a 30-year-old man (Tom Hanks). The script by Gary Ross (Dave) and Anne Spielberg finds some unexpected ways of attacking obvious issues of sex, work, and childhood friendships, and in all of these things the accent is on classy humor and great sensitivity. Hanks is remarkable in the lead, at times hilarious (reacting to caviar just as a 12-year-old would) and at others deeply tender. Penny Marshall became a first-rate filmmaker with this 1988 work.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301578805", "6300214753", "6302936381", "6301569385", "6303049079", "B00000JS61", "6301666569", "6301179552", "630179513X", "6304718551", "6300989003", "6303212379", "B00006G8LB", "6302824729", "6300213668", "B00004TWZK", "6302581907", "6300184269", "0792839129", "6302453356", "B00007E2F6", "6300182916", "630596260X", "0790742322", "6303148387", "B00006AL1C", "6300214370", "B0000YTP0C", "6301157141", "6301763041", "0792837207", "6305177473", "6303236863", "6301404440", "0783219458", "0788809806", "B00005LL26", "6302091632", "6301963911", "6304501668", "B00000490M", "0788812424", "6303409997", "0790705141", "B0002F6BQU", "6304737491", "6302481805", "078880782X", "6302968143", "6304039174"], "bought_together": ["6301578805", "6301569385"], "also_viewed": ["6301796535", "0790742322", "6301792734", "6302877881", "6304718551", "6302516986", "0767825411", "6301697308", "6303212395", "6303212379", "6301157141", "6301398912", "6304233639", "B00000490M", "6302091632", "6300214753", "6300214400", "6300213730", "6302518393", "630021463X", "6300214540", "6300214710", "6303257844", "B0000633ZP", "0783219733", "B00JVLGL2A", "6300275213", "B0006OBPTA", "B000P0J0A6"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 254313}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.99, "brand": "BIG TOM HANKS", "asin": "630339406X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VR9PX6SYL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big [VHS]"}

{"description": "In the tradition ofWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?Hammer Studios drew aging Tallulah Bankhead out of retirement to play the fanatical matriarch ofDie! Die! My Darling!(in Britain the film was simply titledFanatic). Stefanie Powers, fresh from a string of juvenile and ingenue roles, plays her first adult, a thoroughly modern (and sexually liberated) woman who steps out of her time and into Bankhead's decaying mansion, a bit of southern Gothic nestled in the rural England countryside. Her courtesy call to the mother of her deceased lover turns into a cat-and-mouse thriller as the dotty, scripture-reading old lady dedicates herself to \"cleansing\" the befouled girl in memory of her son. Richard Matheson's smart screenplay (from the novelNightmareby Anne Blaisdell) gives Powers a scrappy character, defying Bankhead and struggling to escape at every turn, while Bankhead's increasingly deranged campaign is given a delicious dimension with a marvelously schizophrenic backstory. Director Silvio Narizzano tends to overplay his hand at times and at one point steals a scene right out ofPsycho, but he happily makes the battle of wits the central focus, letting the gothic elements stand as flourish. Peter Vaughan costars as a sleazy, salacious caretaker who can't keep his paws of their captive and Donald Sutherland has a small role as an idiot odd-job man devoted to his bizarre little family.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 479921}, "asin": "6303451578", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41510Y8F2SL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Die Die My Darling [VHS]"}

{"description": "Even as Disney has reveled in the success of its high-end animated features, it occasionally sneaks a lesser effort into theaters, based on one of the many TV shows with which it dominates daytime TV. This one is based on perennial Disney favorite Goofy's adventures in domesticated bliss. Goofy is now a single dad; when son Max gets blamed for a prank gone wrong at school, Goofy blames himself and decides that, for his vacation, he's going to get away with Max alone. Of course, this is no treat for Max, who has just met the girl of his dreams and harbors no wish to spend the summer touring America with his square dad. The vacation is one disaster after another, though they aren't particularly funny disasters; the culmination involves Goofy's efforts to get Max backstage at a big rock concert.

{"description": "Ever since this convoluted thriller dazzled audiences and critics in 1995 and won an Oscar for Christopher McQuarrie's twisting screenplay,The Usual Suspectshas continued to divide movie lovers into opposite camps. While a lot of people take great pleasure from the movie's now-famous central mystery (namely, \"Who is Keyser S&ouml;ze?\"), others aren't so easily impressed by a movie that's too enamored of its own cleverness to make much sense. After all, what are we to make of a final scene that renders the entire movie obsolete? Half the fun ofThe Usual Suspectsis the debate it provokes and the sheer pleasure of watching its dynamic cast in action, led (or should we say, mislead) by Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey as the club-footed con man who recounts the saga of enigmatic Hungarian mobster Keyser S&ouml;ze. Spacey's in a band of thieves that includes Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro, all gathered in a plot to steal a large shipment of cocaine. The story is told in flashback as a twisted plot being described by Spacey's character to an investigating detective (Chazz Palmintieri), andThe Usual Suspectsis enjoyable for the way it keeps the viewer guessing right up to its surprise ending. Whether that ending will enhance or extinguish the pleasure is up to each viewer to decide. Even if it ultimately makes little or no sense at all, this is a funny and fiendish thriller, guaranteed to entertain even its vocal detractors.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0800125762", "0800125789", "6302935148", "0783222955", "B00005QATY", "B00003CWL5", "6304259131", "6300215741"], "also_viewed": ["6304140851"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 469637}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "6303908306", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z2K7HPEJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition  [VHS]"}

{"description": "Movie adaptations of Jane Austen's classic novels were all the rage (relatively speaking) in the mid-1990s.Cluelessupdated Austen'sEmma, which was more conventionally adapted in another version (Emma) starring Gwyneth Paltrow.Emmawas produced yet again, this time for British television, as were a celebrated miniseries ofPride and Prejudiceand this splendid film of Austen'sPersuasion.Persuasionis the story of a love that survives eight years of dormancy and the frustrating obstacles of class prejudice in 19th century England. Anne (Amanda Root) is captivated when she meets the dignified naval officer Capt. Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), but she is advised to discourage his romantic overtures because he has no fortune. They meet again eight years later, but now Capt. Wentworth has become wealthy while Anne's father is in reduced circumstances in the wake of reckless extravagance.

{"description": "George Romero's 1978 follow-up to his classicNight of the Living Deadis quite terrifying and gory (those zombies do like the taste of living flesh). But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It is Romero's take on Louis XVI in the modern world: keep the starving masses at bay and crank up the insulated indulgence.

{"description": "As far as ice-skating movies go (or those that prominently feature the cold-bladed sport), this romantic movie is one of the best, thanks to utterly charming performances by underrated actors D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly. The couple play, respectively, a washed-up hockey player and a prima-donna skater who end up in doubles figure skating together at the Winter Olympics. Of course, the mismatched pair fall in love. In between, there's a lot of verbal sparring, talk of toe picks, and surprisingly skillful directing by Paul Michael Glaser (Kazaam,The Air Up There). Direction here is critical--unlike inFlashdance, where the dancing was done in the shadows, face and feet obviously shot separately--andThe Cutting Edgecredibly highlights the actors and their professional stand-ins.

{"description": "This Academy Award winner for Best Picture is a sweeping soap opera about the guests at the Grand Hotel. Several plots intertwine, but mostly it's about Stars! Stars! Stars! Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, and both Barrymore brothers head up the cast. Garbo is luminous as Grusinskaya, the neurotic and famous-but-slipping dancer and, yes, she \"vonts to be alone.\" John Barrymore is a cat burglar with blue blood and a heart of gold, and Lionel Barrymore happily caroms off him as Mr. Kringelein, a dying man who wants to live out the time he has left with the rich. Joan Crawford is perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie: as Flaemmchen, a young career girl trying to decide between secretary and tart, she is uncharacteristically funny, vivacious, and downright bubbly. Along the way we discover that money, fame, and titles don't guarantee happiness, and being a jewel thief doesn't necessarily make you a bad person. The nicest touch is the hint that other, minor plots swirl around the edges of the film, suggesting that we've only seen a small chapter of the hotel's story.Grand Hotelis a great deal of fun and an excellent chance to see some famous faces in their prime.--Ali Davis", "related": {"also_bought": ["6301670140", "6300158683", "6300273210", "0792837967", "630266232X", "1558807780", "6301978536", "6302842263", "6301976983", "0792837371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 560387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 3.7, "brand": "", "asin": "6304308469", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51962X724BL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Grand Hotel [VHS]"}

{"description": "Audrey Hepburn's last Oscar nomination was for this adaptation of Frederick Knott's famed stage thriller about a blind woman, a con man (Alan Arkin), and a doll full of heroin. Thanks to Hepburn's husband, a photographer who does a good deal of traveling, she's unknowingly come into possession of said doll, which was given to him on a plane by a comely young drug runner who winds up dead. The murderous Arkin, aided by sympathetic henchman Richard Crenna, will let nothing stand in the way of his obtaining it, even if it comes down to assaying multiple \"personalities\" in order to visit and terrorize Hepburn; Crenna is unwillingly enlisted to help. However, the \"world's champion blind lady\" (as Hepburn sardonically states) is more than up to the task of defending herself in her basement Manhattan apartment in a heart-stopping climax that to this day still defines the way horror movies with jack-in-the-box psychos are made. Despite the obvious staginess of it all (the entire action takes place in Hepburn's apartment), it still works magnificently, thanks to Hepburn's steely will and Arkin's deadly, sadistic madman. A helpful hint: turn out all the lights when you watch it; theaters back in 1967 did so, killing the guiding lights during the film's last 15 minutes.

{"description": "Halloweenis as pure and undiluted as its title.  In the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, a teenage baby sitter  tries to survive a Halloween night of relentless terror, during which  a knife-wielding maniac goes after the town's hormonally charged  youths. Director John Carpenter takes this simple situation and  orchestrates a superbly mounted symphony of horrors. It's a movie much scarier for its dark spaces and ominous camera movements  than for its explicit bloodletting (which is actually minimal). Composed  by Carpenter himself, the movie's freaky music sets the tone; and his  script (cowritten with Debra Hill) is laced with references to other  horror pictures, especiallyPsycho. The baby sitter is played  by Jamie Lee Curtis, the real-life daughter ofPsychovictim  Janet Leigh; and the obsessed policeman played by Donald Pleasence  is named Sam Loomis, after John Gavin's character inPsycho.  In the end, though,Halloweenstands on its own as an  uncannily frightening experience--it's one of those movies that had  audiences literally jumping out of their seats and shouting at the  screen. (\"No! Don't drop that knife!\") Produced on a low budget,  the picture turned a monster profit, and spawned many sequels,  none of which approached the 1978 original. Curtis returned for two  more installments: 1981's dismalHalloween II, which picked  up the story the day after the unfortunate events, and 1998's occasionally  grippingHalloween H20, which proved the former baby sitter  was still haunted after 20 years.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4Q", "B000FA57UI", "B000FA57US", "B000Q66Q2O", "B005CFC0N8", "B004P7CNUY", "B0000AOX09", "B004P7CM9Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B00006LPHA", "B002XD0J80", "B00AQJ8MLY", "B001NPD9LS", "B002YICNE2", "B000GETUDI", "B000FS9FE4", "B001DJLD1W", "B00AEFY2LO", "B00006FI0R", "B00AEFY2WI", "B005CFBYW6", "B00006FDBT", "B00AEFY31S", "B00AEFY37C", "B00005K3NR", "B00004TS0G", "B003UGLCIA", "B0087ZG7UW", "B000I2J68M", "B000V4UFZK", "B0000VCZMK", "B0033B5XCS", "B000AM6OQ2", "B0002JP572", "B002VWNIDG", "B0058S0OMS", "B000099T3M", "B00AEFY1V0", "B002ZG971U", "B00AEFYYH6", "B00003CXCF", "B004LWZW2O", "B001B1UO6W", "B00006FDCD", "B000E1ZBIG", "B004SIP9MY", "B000TSIJWY", "B000WC3864", "B004AC6PMG", "B001DJLD0S", "B000QQJ3Q0", "B004P7CMT6", "B0002CHK1S", "B000FC2GA0", "B008CYDD7I", "B0008191WO", "B0024FADD8", "B0053TWVDC", "B00018D42W", "B00AEFY2AA", "B00DTPRZ24", "B000KJU1KK", "B00AEFY2E6", "B0000CEB6Y", "B0006SGYL0", "B00004Y87O", "B0013D8LAE", "B00005JA8B", "B006ZL1P66", "B000GBEWRU", "B000IMUYJM", "B005J9ZFQG", "B001JFZ1UE", "B007STBUHI", "B000E8M0P6", "6305972001", "B00079Z9WI", "B00005A8XX", "B00009PY4G", "B000FAOC2W", "B000AA4JL6", "B0002C4JJ4", "B0002O7XW2", "B008JFUNYG", "B000HEWEGC", "B002LMSWN2", "B00BM4Q4H6", "B000HCO86I", "B008874968", "0783227434", "B0006SSOHC", "B001JFZ122", "B004LWZW24", "B000Q66Q8I", "B00001QGUM", "B000OYCMLM", "B000PMLJMQ", "B00000ILDD", "B00A1AU72A", "B004SIP9E2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KDU8HQQ", "B00005LC4Q", "B000VKL6Z2", "B002YICNE2"]}, "price": 19.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 349265}, "asin": "6304697961", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NXT68J3CL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Halloween"}
{"description": "The idea of fusing teen sex-comedy and horror genres into a boffo box-office bonanza seems like classic braindead Hollywood-think... but somehow, beyond all reason, the makers of this film manage to pull it off. Much of the credit goes to director Fran Rubel Kuzui (Tokyo Pop) who chooses wisely to let the jokes and action rip by so quickly that viewers won't have time to realize there's practically nothing going on. Also excellent is Kristy Swanson as the bubble-headed cheerleader who learns from a Van Helsing-ish stranger (Donald Sutherland) that she's, like, the reincarnation of this pure female warrior and stuff, destined to rid the world--or at least the Valley--of vampires. No sooner is the Buffster being schooled in the ways of vampire butt-kicking (much to the consternation of meek pretty-boy beau Luke Perry) than the lead vampire (Rutger Hauer) and his leering cronies show up, and leading up the pack is none other than Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens.

{"description": "Vittorio De Sica's remarkable 1947 drama of desperation and survival in Italy's devastating post-war depression earned a special Oscar for its affecting power. Shot in the streets and alleys of Rome, De Sica uses the real-life environment of contemporary life to frame his moving drama of a desperate father whose new job delivering cinema posters is threatened when a street thief steals his bicycle. Too poor to buy another, he and his son take to the streets in an impossible search for his bike. Cast with nonactors and filled with the real street life of Rome, this landmark film helped define the Italian neorealist approach with its mix of real life details, poetic imagery, and warm sentimentality. De Sica uses the wandering pair to witness the lives of everyday folks, but ultimately he paints a quiet, poignant portrait of father and son, played by nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola, whose understated performances carry the heart of the film. De Sica and scenarist Cesare Zavattini also collaborated onShoeshine,Miracle in Milan, andUmberto D, all classics in the neorealist vein, but none of which approach the simple poetry and quiet power achieved inThe Bicycle Thief.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["1572524448"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 492162}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.86, "brand": "", "asin": "6304963173", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712GEZEYA3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Bicycle Thief [VHS]"}

{"description": "Making this movie represented a rather risky venture for Mel Gibson--it was his first effort at directing, and the role demanded that he deliberately obscure his sexy matinee-idol looks. Gibson seems to truly relish his Lon Chaney Jr.-esque turn as Justin McLeod, a reclusive former teacher with half his face and body badly scarred, and a dark, secret past. The folks in McLeod's postcard-pretty Maine town have dubbed him \"Hamburger Head\" and exchange malicious gossip about him. But one boy is needy enough to dare to penetrate the fortress McLeod has built against the outside world. Fatherless Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is so anxious to escape his dysfunctional family that he pesters McLeod into becoming his mentor. Their relationship for the most part avoids the sort of sticky sentimentality one might expect from Hollywood. Chuck is a real, credible kid, a petulant pain with a chip on his shoulder, and McLeod is no Mr. Chips. It's fun, and quite moving, to watch these two cranky misfits battle their way toward a friendship that will change both their lives. Margaret Whitton (Major League) gives an unaffected performance as Chuck's narcissistic mother. \"I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket,\" she tells her rudderless children, as she flits from man to man. Gibson's own personal code of honor, we suspect, is very much in evidence in this movie's message: One must take responsibility for what one wants in life.--Laura Mirsky", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 450110}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.95, "brand": "", "asin": "6305012814", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5128XQKSB4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Man Without A Face [VHS]"}
{"description": "David O. Selznick wantedGone with the Windto be somehow more than a movie, a film that would broaden the very idea of what a film could be and do and look like. In many respects he got what he worked so hard to achieve in this 1939 epic (and all-time box-office champ in terms of tickets sold), and in some respects he fell far short of the goal. While the first half of this Civil War drama is taut and suspenseful and nostalgic, the second is ramshackle and arbitrary. But there's no question that the film is an enormous achievement in terms of its every resource--art direction, color, sound, cinematography--being pushed to new limits for the greater glory of telling an American story as fully as possible. Vivien Leigh is still magnificently narcissistic, Olivia de Havilland angelic and lovely, Leslie Howard reckless and aristocratic.

{"description": "If you were to argue that Mel Brooks'sYoung Frankensteinranks among the top-ten funniest movies of all time, nobody could reasonably dispute the claim. Spoofing classic horror in the way that Brooks's previous filmBlazing Saddlessent up classic Westerns, the movie is both a loving tribute and a raucous, irreverent parody of Universal's classic horror filmsFrankenstein(1931) andBride of Frankenstein(1935). Filming in glorious black and white, Brooks re-created theFrankensteinlaboratory using the same equipment from the originalFrankenstein(courtesy of designer Kenneth Strickfaden), and this loving attention to physical and stylistic detail creates a solid foundation for nonstop comedy. The story, of course, involves Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) and his effort to resume experiments in re-animation pioneered by his late father. (He's got some help, since dad left behind a book titledHow I Did It.) Assisting him is the hapless hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman) and the buxom but none-too-bright maiden Inga (Teri Garr), and when Frankenstein succeeds in creating his monster (Peter Boyle), the stage is set for an outrageous revision of the Frankenstein legend. With comedy highlights too numerous to mention, Brooks guides his brilliant cast (also including Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman in a classic cameo role) through scene after scene of inspired hilarity. Indeed,Young Frankensteinis a charmed film, nothing less than a comedy classic, representing the finest work from everyone involved. Not one joke has lost its payoff, and none of the countless gags have lost their zany appeal. From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered. Befitting a classic, the Special Edition DVD includes audio commentary by Mel Brooks, a \"making of\" documentary, interviews with the cast, hilarious bloopers and outtakes, and the original theatrical trailers. No video library should be without a copy ofYoung Frankenstein.

{"description": "Here's a sick little movie for you--a creepy-funny shocker that's become a semi-cult classic since its release in 1982. It's a cheesy, low-budget horror flick about a small-town geek who arrives in New York City's Times Square carrying his mutant, telepathic twin brother in a big basket (hence the movie's title, get it?). They were once Siamese twins, and now they're seeking gory revenge against the doctors who surgically separated them against their will! Talk about brotherly love! The \"normal\" sibling has to keep his brother well- fed, and the basket-dweller's appetite runs the gamut from hamburgers to hookers. There's plenty of lowlife \"meat\" to be found in the seedy motel where the brothers live. Not exactly mainstream fare, as you might already have guessed, but director Frank Henenlotter handles the gruesomeness with resourceful ingenuity. The movie even gathered enough horror-buff momentum to spawn two lesser sequels in 1990 and 1992, which is all the proof you need to add this dubious trilogy to the gross-out hall of fame.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000V6LT08", "B008S2CTWY", "B000094J72", "B0053TWW9K", "B00004Z1GI", "B008CYDD7I", "B000068TPD", "B000JU7JIW", "B000096I9V", "B0007WQHI0", "B0024FAG44", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B0002DB5PO", "B00DWG5GIA", "B0053TWW36", "B000GIXCL0", "B000HT38B2", "157362408X", "B008DL4LN0", "B0002VYOVS", "B001D5C1R6", "B0002C9DK4", "B0036R92US", "6305841985", "B004KDYR20", "B004FUPK6U", "B000UDGO9S", "B000S0GYRU", "B00ARWX9NG", "B009IV2Z3M", "0783228457", "B0001ZX0GK", "B00009YXHN", "B00009WNXA", "B001BP14MG", "B000HXDWRS", "B0016MJ6P6", "B00004KDER", "B002E01MHY", "B0057O6IMS", "B00AGKH4MG", "B00023P4SS", "B001D5C1OO", "B00005N5RM", "B000T28POC", "B000RPCK2O", "B005ZHBEPI", "B001B8XRT6", "B0002IQLH6", "B000S0GYRK", "6304723113", "B000F3UA8E", "B000WC389G", "B005CVFZ66", "B0001US7OA", "B0006FO56Y", "B000OYCMLM", "B00009PY4C", "630472313X", "B000FS9FE4", "B0053TWWAE", "B004EI2NP4", "B003L1YESE", "B001M0NJ0K", "B00CERJI5U", "B0016LFG2E", "B0002Z0F12", "B000MX7V3O", "B0000DC12T", "B003JIPN20", "B001QMCJ4Q", "B0055HK79C", "B000TZJCN2", "B0009OUBC4", "B005OT7ZWI", "B0072GPQ8G", "B000E8M0P6", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00JQYV0B4", "B0002S9QUA", "B003THSXJ6", "B002I41KNC", "B0055CP9TU", "B0053TWV46", "B000IMUYJM", "B005OT810I", "6304852444", "B00GHH9IIA", "B000RPCJA2", "B004VQRCJG", "B0053TWVQE", "B008DVJOQ4", "B0009X768W", "B000068IEV", "B000MV8ABS", "B000E1P2EY", "069220315X", "B0000694WL", "B00DOZNGTK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00004Z1GI", "B008N02TGC", "B00DWG5GIA", "B000068TPD"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 464932}, "asin": "6305186677", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513TPA33T4L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Basket Case"}
{"description": "Halloweenis one of the great modern horror films, but as a franchise its track record has been spotty at best, painfully bad at worst.Halloween H2O: Twenty Years Later, directed by horror vet Steve Miner (Friday the 13thparts 2 and 3,House), won't displace John Carpenter's original but it might help you forget the films in between. Miner certainly has: the film begins as if sequels 3 through 6 never happened. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role for the first time in almost two decades) faked her death and is now a single mom and headmistress of an exclusive California private school. She's also a secret alcoholic who lives in fear of her homicidal brother-bogeyman Michael Myers. Guess who decides to show up for a family reunion? The film begins with classic horror-movie exposition (the deserted college campus, Michael's escape, Laurie's waking nightmares) accomplished with some humor and style, but it's all setup for the second half, a driving roller coaster of stalk-and-slash thrills. There's little of the self-conscious genre referencing ofScreamand at times the film is a little far-fetched--it is a slasher movie about a knife-wielding homicidal maniac who won't stay dead, after all--but Curtis transforms Laurie from a shrieking victim into an empowered, determined horror-movie heroine who's learned a thing or two from the previous films.

{"description": "Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama, a commentary on all-pervasive media manipulation. Scripted by Andrew M. Niccol (Gattaca), the film plays like a combination of the British TV series The Prisoner and Paul Bartel's The Secret Cinema. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24-hour-a-day TV series. In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, \"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\" Employed at an insurance company, Truman is married to merry Meryl (Laura Linney), and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island \"paradise\" where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water, intentionally instilled in him when his father \"died\" in a boating accident and was written out of the script.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790731649"], "bought_together": ["0790731649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 319413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.0, "brand": "", "asin": "630518299X", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GRFF4KA1L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Truman Show [VHS]"}

A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely.

{"description": "Robert Bolt's successful play was not considered a hot commercial property by Columbia Pictures--a period piece about a moral issue without a star, without even a love story. Perhaps that's why Columbia left director Fred Zinnemann alone to makeA Man for All Seasons, as long as he stuck to a relatively small budget. The results took everyone by surprise, as the talky morality play became a box-office hit and collected the top Oscars for 1966. At the play's heart is the standoff between King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in young lion form) and Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield, in an Oscar-winning performance). Henry wants More's official approval of divorce, but More's strict ethical and religious code will not let him waffle. More's rectitude is a source of exasperation to Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles in a cameo), who chides, \"If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint.\" Zinnemann's approach is all simplicity, and indeed the somewhat prosaic staging doesn't create a great deal of cinematic excitement. But the language is worth savoring, and the ethical politics are debated with all the calm and majesty of an absorbing chess game.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056HEA", "B0057FGCRI", "B0000B1A58", "B001D5F2LI", "B0006GANX2", "B00008J2PG", "B00005AUKE", "B000BITV92", "B0006HBV3W", "B000BYA4HE", "B00AEFY6DI", "B00008LDO7", "076781326X", "B000XJD34I", "B00012FXJ0", "B00004TVUD", "0780021312", "0385496931", "B0018LX9RG", "B004FQX5A2", "B003WEAW04", "B002QXOYQK", "0679728228", "B00003CXBH", "B000FFJ83K", "B001NSLE5I", "B0000549B1", "B00005JKF6", "B000KX0IOA", "B000255LIY", "B00006ADD5", "B00005AUKB", "B000KJTGHO", "B00003CXBU", "B001GLX6TY", "B00004XPPC", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000WMFZMY", "B00005JN8Z", "B00011D1OK", "0898706254", "B00125WAXM", "B0001US8F8", "B0000633QW", "B00006RCO2", "6304907729", "B001D8W7EU", "B00GHU35HM", "B000E1MXTG", "B00AMSM9CW", "0767827775", "B00096S412", "B001GUYAZY", "B0051WTN50", "B00005MEOU", "6305257450", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000E1MXT6", "B000FL7C9G", "B0009S4IKQ", "B000MTEGSG", "B0045HCJQM", "B002VWNIBI", "B000E1ZBFY", "B00011D1OU", "B000LXWAI6", "B00005V1WY", "B00D3K357O", "B006FE83UE", "B0045HCJJY", "B0006GANY6", "B0002BO05S", "B00006RCO3", "B00GA8Z0B0", "B0010AN7Z4", "B00F6SHECS", "B001MVYUQ6", "0783240171", "B00BYCOIU6", "B000KGGJ0Y", "B004XYOQU4"], "bought_together": ["B000056HEA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000056HEA", "0679728228", "B0057FGCRI", "B000255LIY"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 125062}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.37, "brand": "", "asin": "6305252564", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-2r8McJlL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Man for All Seasons"}
{"description": "Werner Herzog's remake of F.W. Murnau'soriginal vampire classicis at once a generous tribute to the great German director and a distinctly unique vision by one of cinema's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Though Murnau'sNosferatuwas actually an unauthorized adaptation of Bram  Stoker'sDracula, Herzog based his film largely on Murnau's conceptions--at times directly quoting Murnau's images--but manages to slip in a few references to Tod Browning'sfamous version(at one point the vampire comments on the howling wolves: \"Listen, the children of the night make their music.\"). Longtime Herzog star Klaus Kinski is both hideous and melancholy as Nosferatu (renamed Count Dracula in the English language version). As in Murnau's film, he's a veritable gargoyle with his bald pate and sunken eyes, and his talon-like fingernails and two snaggly fangs give him a distinctly feral quality. But Kinski's haunting eyes also communicate a gloomy loneliness--the curse of his undead immortality--and his yearning for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) becomes a melancholy desire for love. Bruno Ganz's sincere but foolish Jonathan is doomed to the vampire's will and his wife, Lucy, a holy innocent whose deathly pallor and nocturnal visions link her with the ghoulish Nosferatu, becomes the only hope against the monster's plague-like curse. Herzog's dreamy, delicate images and languid pacing create a stunningly beautiful film of otherworldly mood, a faithful reinterpretation that by the conclusion has been shaped into a quintessentially Herzog vision.--Sean Axmaker", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 272814}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "title": "Nosferatu the Vampyre [VHS]", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000056NW6", "6302783356", "B000VUQ4HW", "6304509154"], "also_viewed": ["6302194296", "B00EO2I6RO"]}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5123FXMFFAL._SY300_.jpg", "asin": "630526323X"}

Packed with non-stop action, spectacular special effects and unprecedented stunts, this \"domestic epic\" from director James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) is a rollicking `90's twist on the super spy genre.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002GHHHME", "B00070FX5U", "0783225504", "B000BPL2FQ", "B00AKGG828", "B000RJO56E", "B000RW3VCK", "6305767866", "B00005N5S5", "B00HZMZ2FE", "B00005JKIP", "B001VLBDD0", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JA8B", "6304711891", "0767803434", "0783226926", "B0006GANOQ", "B000056PMU", "B0045HCJGC", "B00000G3PA", "B000TJBN6W", "B001KRVLCI", "B002MJV7HW", "B000K0YLM8", "B000FO0AA6", "B000U1ZV8K", "B000O77SRC", "6304806434", "0790736411", "B0045HCJFS", "B00008G8M4", "B001TK80C0", "B0001Z37HM", "B0045HCJG2", "6305236569", "6304779631", "B00005ATZT", "B000QUCRB4", "B002AS466O", "B001B3LIOC", "B001CT877Q", "B00AEFY4CG", "0783235070", "B00004STDN", "0780618548", "B00008G8LY", "B0002WZTOI", "B000EGDB10", "B00081U7HC", "B000YCPUWW", "B003IMMEL0", "B002O3Z50G", "B00AKGG6XY", "0790732149", "B0000VD12I", "B000FO0A9W", "1558908846", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFY3MC", "B0045HCJ5S", "B00K31RC20", "B002GIBVVG", "B003AWRMBA", "6305213283", "B0004Z33G4", "6305428115", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00AEBB99Q", "B000SFOW8I", "B001FB55HQ", "0783225946", "B000055Y0Y", "B0000DIXDR", "B000ARXF96", "0783240295", "B002ZG999U", "0783230370", "B002VWNID6", "0767807588", "B0002V7OI8", "B00158K0QU", "B00AEFYUQQ", "6304884400", "B0000YEEGM", "B000MGBSE4", "B00AEFXDO6", "B000JYW5BE", "B0004Z33EG", "B000056PNL", "B004NTDF0G", "B000ELJAEM", "B003AWRMC4", "6304712898", "0783227396", "B000ASATZ8", "6305161879", "B00BLF9FOK", "B00AEFXYOA", "0783226934"], "bought_together": ["0783225504"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783225504", "B000GUJYI8", "0800177975", "B00070FX5U"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 156134}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 16.89, "brand": "", "asin": "6305364648", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518N0XW209L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "True Lies"}
{"description": "Can we talk? Everybody is pretty well agreed that Great Britain's Ken Loach  is one of our most important filmmakers. On the basis of his work with  actors alone--often actors who are unknown until showcased in his films--he commands a place in the modern Pantheon. The problem is that hesoundsterminally \"worthy\"; his films invariably reflect a commitment to framing  harsh sociopolitical realities and steeping us in the fight for justice, a square deal, or a square meal. They sound, in short, as if they're \"good for  you\"--whereas the fact is that they're almost always damnedgood, period.My Name Is Joemakes for an excellent introduction to Loach country--partly  because it's just a tad more immediate in its basic viewer appeal. Joe  Kavanagh (Peter Mullan), out-of-work Glasgow housepainter, is a terrifically  attractive fellow, and though he's also a recovering alcoholic, he seems  eminently pulled-together and ready for yeoman service as a movie leading  man. The main story line concerns his encounter with and growing attraction  to a smart social worker (Louise Goodall). There's nothing star-crossed  about their potential love, but each is tough enough to set limits till  they've traveled over a distance of mutual ground. Meanwhile, Joe's status as role model among his more emotionally and economically precarious  neighbors--an extended family of man--is good for a surprising number of  lusty laughs and one fatal, criminal complication that could jeopardize his future. Peter Mullan won a well-deserved Best Actor award at Cannes in 1998,  and subsequently directed a family comedy-drama of his own,Orphans.--Richard&nbsp;T.

{"description": "InThe Bat, top-billed Vincent Price brings his silky sinister elegance to the second remake of the hoary \"old dark house\" stage play, but the real star of the show is Agnes Moorehead as an eccentric mystery writer who decides to pull off the million-dollar bank heist and the steel-clawed killer known only as \"The Bat.\" Price's devious doctor is but one of a rogues gallery of suspects that include a Johnny-on-the-spot police detective, a chauffeur turned butler with a checkered past, and a housekeeper with echoes ofRebecca's Mrs. Danvers. Moorehead is a kick as the spirited author and makes the most of her expanded role, but fans of the early film productions (1926'sThe Batand 1930'sThe Bat Whispers, both directed by Roland West) will be less forgiving of other changes, especially writer-director Crane Wilbur's decision to draw the story out over a succession of nights. Wilbur loses the tension and claustrophobia of the originals with handsome but airy photography, more appropriate to an episode ofPerry Mason, and a rambling pace. Moorehead and Price bring a little spirit to the otherwise bland film, but not quite enough.William Castle's gimmick-laden comic thrillerHouse on Haunted Hillis not so much a horror movie as a fairground fun house come to life. Vincent Price stars as a deliciously silky millionaire married to a greedy gold digger (Carol Ohmart) who refuses to divorce him. When he turns his wife's idea for a haunted-house party into a contest--$10,000 to whoever can spend the night in \"the only truly haunted house in the world\"--it seems he may have found an alternative to divorce. Five strangers gather to test their stamina, Price hands each of them most delightfully twisted party favors ever imagined (loaded handguns, delivered in their own tiny coffins), and the spook show begins. Blood drips from the ceiling, zombielike apparitions float through rooms, severed heads and skeletons suddenly appear, and then a guest is found hanging in the stairwell. Full of screams and shocks and things that go bump in the night,House on Haunted Hillisn't particularly scary and often makes little sense, but, like a Halloween haunted house, the gag-laden spectacle of spook-show clich&eacute;s is quite entertaining and Price makes a sardonic master of ceremonies. The original theatrical presentations featured a typically outrageous Castle-engineered gimmick: Emergo, which was nothing more than a skeleton that appeared to fly out of the screen and over the audience on a guide wire.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00LMBURV8", "B00009PY4D", "B00000K3U3", "B00LMBURDG", "B00FMGPWNW", "B00H4KQN82", "B000FKO3VM", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B00009PY4A", "B00FERT0PK", "B00FM4S68W", "B001BSBBNK", "B005AMJ3B0", "B00LBFFR2Y", "B00JHH22O4", "B00009PY45", "B00GNZM03G", "B0007R4SZY", "B001AD6UFA", "B000RXVNDI", "B00DI68EBK", "B00LC4PFVW", "B00DOZNGC2", "B005AMJ36U", "B00005AUK0", "B00LC4PBTS", "B00DE1LD6W", "B00DOZNI8Y", "B00K6D1R0I", "B00L22H2IS", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00H7BJ0C4", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00D9EJFV4", "B00005NKTH", "B00FOLGW3E", "B00KIZY2QA", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00L8QOZK6", "B00FGAKEEQ", "B00000ILEU", "B00KOW4BOU", "B000068TPE", "B00EU8RBZK", "B00D9EJFZA", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00HZVX14O", "B00IYJFB2G", "B008FYZHPG", "B00KIZYDCI", "B00GH6U6J6", "B0009X770E", "B000WNHTCC", "B00E0FW0M2", "B00005N5RQ", "B00005R1O7", "B000RXVND8", "B004NDJXNK", "B001BSBBMQ", "B00FJYXP36", "B00JJOY47I", "B00JV054A6", "B00JV054CO", "B0088XQDTS", "B00K1L4NBU", "B004LB5FAY", "B00DTECHWS", "B00IF0KAYS", "B004RPQSVE", "B00L6AW1K0", "B004CZZZ0O", "B0033PSH6S", "B00JJOY45U", "B00HRUQ8X4", "B000FWHW90", "B00CLIAACC", "B007HCI4SE", "B00000JQB7", "B0000694WH", "B000068TPG", "B004X63SCY", "B005ETAN7C", "B005E7SFDI", "B00EO2I6RO", "B000UDGOBG", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00EBDXVVW", "B00FL2F1O2", "B000RXVNCY", "B005ZVINFS", "B0034PWPHY", "B00005K3OF", "B004RPQSNM", "B00E21D8M0", "B00D80GMP6", "B003IRUFBG", "B002DY9KQG", "B00005LC4N"], "bought_together": ["B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001AD6UFA", "B001BSBBGC", "B00000K3U3", "B002NZK5X2"]}, "price": 13.46, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 411447}, "asin": "6305436452", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71CQPQ131EL._SY300_.gif", "title": "Horror Classics, Vol. 3: The Bat/House on Haunted Hill"}
{"description": "There's Something About Maryis one of the funniest movies in years, recalling the days of the Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movies, in which (often tasteless) gags were piled on at a fierce rate. The difference is that cowriters and codirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly have also crafted a credible story line and even tossed in some genuine emotional content.The Farrelly brothers' first two movies,Dumb and DumberandKingpin, had some moments of uproarious raunch, but were uneven. WithMary, they've created a consistently hilarious romantic comedy, made all the funnier by the fact that you know that they know that some of their gags go way over the line.Cameron Diaz stars as Mary, every guy's ideal. Ben Stiller plays a high-school suitor still hung up on Mary years later; the obstacles standing between him and her include a number of psychotic suitors, a miserable little pooch, and, oh yeah, a murder charge.The Farrellys' admittedly simplistic camera work, which adapts easily to a TV screen, and the fact that you'll likely laugh yourself so silly over certain scenes you'll want to replay them to see what you were missing while you were busy convulsing, make this a perfect video movie.--David Kronke", "related": {"also_bought": ["6300214567"], "also_viewed": ["B00004YZEG"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 467528}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.01, "brand": "", "asin": "6305499071", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T5QB162RL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "There's Something About Mary (Special Edition) [VHS]"}

{"description": "Are you wondering just exactly who the Blair Witch was? What the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend was all about? Or what exactly fascinated student filmmaker Heather and what possibly took her, Mike, and Josh from this earth? Get all your background questions answered byCurse of the Blair Witch, a one-stop-shopping \"documentary\" originally produced for the Sci-Fi Channel as a tie-in marketing tool. Entirely fictionalized,Curse of the Blair Witchfocuses both on the past and the present, with copious info on the Blair Witch myth as well as on the disappearance of Heather, Josh, and Mike. As it turns out, the original witch was one Elly Kedward, who was accused in 1785 of taking blood from several children; she was subsequently banished to the harsh winter woods and left for dead. Her grisly and bloody legacy involves missing children, polluted water, disemboweled men, and a serial killer of children who claims to have been haunted by \"an old woman ghost.\" Aside from some ineffective \"newsreel\" footage of the serial killer, all this intriguing information is presented convincingly and chillingly.Cursemay in fact freak you out more than the movie, and it evokes the great, pulpyIn Search Ofseries of the '70s, one of the prime inspirations for filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. News clips of the search for Heather, Josh, and Mike lend a v&eacute;rit&eacute; atmosphere to the proceedings, but shed little light on their mysterious disappearance or their characters. Basically, it's a tease to go see the movie.

{"description": "The tradition of Japan's underground Grand Guignol psycho-drama  continues inOrgan, a grotesque, gooey thriller of human organ pirates, deviant sex killers, and festering biology experiments.  Undercover cops infiltrate the dank, underground operating theater of a street gang selling black market organs, but before backup arrives one of them is literally dissected in front of the other. The surgical victim winds up a human guinea pig in the doctor's private greenhouse (\"He looks like that guy inThe Fly,\" offers one visitor). His partner keeps his skin intact but loses his mind and becomes obsessed with tracking down the ringleader of the operation, the ferocious, one-eyed Yoko (played by the director Kei Fujiwara, costar of the cyber-punk horror classicTetsuo: The Iron Man).That's the plot in a nutshell, but this hallucinatory film is almost incoherent, a grotesque stew of pus and blood and severed limbs. Like much of the new wave of Japanese horror, the violence is more conceptual than explicit, full of perverse imagery and deviant characters.Organis messy in every sense of the word. It gets so knotted in excess that it often loses it's way in wandering story lines, horrifying flashbacks (it turns out that Yoko and the doctor are siblings with a terrible childhood secret), and wild dreams and fantasies. Perhaps that's the madness to Fujiwara's method: how can anyone keep their grip on reality in such a nightmarish world?The DVD features the complete and uncut print of the film (which was censored in Japan) and a 20-minute featurette with scenes from a bigger budgeted sequelOrgan 2(which became a big hit in Japan), narrated in English by director Fujiwara.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305789649", "B001WAVVGY", "B0014567YI", "B000JJSJ82", "B005DKS21G", "B0012K8WG6", "B000FZEU3I", "B0064SVNMQ", "B0082A3HFK", "B000MM0LH8", "B00AATUZSI", "B000FS9FIA", "B002FE5XUQ", "B004KDYR20", "B002E2QH8G", "B000O76TOU", "B0001IXSZ0", "B000OCY7TE", "B000HXDWTQ", "B00004TJM8", "B000NQ28OW", "B001B187L6", "6305836965", "B002IRYYD2", "B000JU7JIW", "B003AL9YFI", "B00668IE3U", "B000G5R98A", "B000E3LGMY", "B00008MHC1", "B000KRNG54", "6305477728", "B000GNOSFE", "B00009KTVX", "B001OBBS4Q", "B000V6LT6C", "B003VL3UR0", "B0085X31PK", "B0002C9DJK", "B0007M23D8", "B002DWW6KU", "B001V732VK", "B000NO243E", "B000JJSJ9G", "B0018JKLT2", "B00005U12U", "B00006IUK2", "B0000JLLAO", "B0016Q1KRO", "B000059PP0", "B000FZEQWI", "B000G5R97Q", "B000GB5M92", "B000096I9W", "B00CF8WINC", "B0018ZOARK", "B00BCJ12OQ", "B00B2MLM34", "B0018BA72G", "B0016PDZGO", "B0000AQS1H", "B003VOVVXC", "B0040319AS", "B000C20VNW", "B000096IAM", "B001FRNB8U", "1903254620", "B002DU0RFS", "B007XF0XT8", "B0002Z0F12", "B005GVG65G", "B007XF0XYS"], "bought_together": ["6305789649"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 151193}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 14.26, "brand": "", "asin": "6305666385", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214Y88AWNGL.jpg", "title": "Organ"}

{"description": "\"Naked girls and lots of blood, that's whatVampyresis about,\" says Joseph Larraz in the notes to the film. He rewrites the vampire myth to make his bloodsucking lovelies the restless ghosts of lesbian lovers murdered while making love in their shadowy castle. Reappearing nightly in the twilight forest, they lure men to their castle for blood feasts until the brunette vampire, Fran (Marianne Morris), falls for her latest victim (Murray Brown) and decides to keep him alive, a sex slave she slowly drains dry. \"You're playing a dangerous game,\" warns blonde Miriam (Anulka), perhaps just a tad jealous. As the local cops watch a veritable wrecking yard of car crashes fill up the sleepy back roads (all with naked dead men behind the wheels), you have to wonder if anyone finds this a bit suspicious. It's a slim story filled with misty forests, candlelit castle interiors, and the above-mentioned blood and naked flesh. Larraz adds a few poetic flourishes--blood dripping down pale faces, clouds crawling past a castle--but, more important, gives the living dead girls a genuinely passionate relationship and a zest for nightlife. The DVD features commentary by Larraz and producer Brian Smedley-Ashton.--Sean Axmaker", "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 551315}, "asin": "6305807744", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DPF02VN2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Vampyres [VHS]"}

She'll pocket $1 million if she can successfully kill Mastroianni, her 10th and last victim, but on the side she concocts a deal to do the deed in concert with a live song-and-dance extravaganza mounted by a tea company.Directed with tongue firmly in cheek, Petri lampoons the whole media obsession with high-risk contests and games of chance with cool style, absurdly chic fashions, a bouncy score of organ riffs and funky lounge sounds, and a comically blas&eacute; performance by Mastroianni.

{"description": "Having discreetly disbanded at the dawn of the MTV era, the 1970s' most stubbornly faceless pop subversives returned after 19&nbsp;years with their first new studio album, followed in short order by this stunning long-form video project. Part concert, part documentary,Steely Dan: Two Against Natureoffers a savvy cross-section of both old and new material performed by the latest incarnation of the formidable stage bands that founders Walter Becker and Donald Fagen have assembled for the periodic tours unleashed since their early '90s concert reunion. True to form, they preside over immaculately arranged, flawlessly executed performances that confirm the Dan's state-of-the-art standards, then undercut that achievement with devilish audience sound bites and their own faux cable-access interviews, as if to debunk their artistry with a blast of anticelebrity.For hardcore Dan fans (including this reviewer), Becker and  Fagen long ago distanced themselves from rock culture, their music steeped more in '50s jazz and rhythm & blues, and their lyrics pitched to a darker, funnier world-view divorced from youth culture and self-congratulatory rock personae. Fagen, with his close-cropped hair, austere beard, tinted glasses, and prominent incisors resembles a pale, vampiric Ray Charles as he huddles over his keyboards and croons those dangerous lyrics. His partner's longer locks and steel-rimmed glasses reinforce the spectre of a postbop Franz Schubert who's traded clavichords for custom electric guitars--a studious image reinforced by his dry, articulate gibes in the interviews, if undercut by the twisted imagery and shadowy, second-person perspectives pervasive in the band's lyrics (like the music, written by both men, but conspicuously shaped by Becker).The material hews to the  group's later albums recorded after they downsized the band into a de facto studio laboratory and dialed up the jazz accents, with understandable showcases for the sneaky new songs on theTwo Against Naturealbum: sleek, seductive songs about incest, midlife crises, pyromania, designer drugs, and other fun stuff. Sonically, the performances are as meticulously recorded and mixed as the duo's albums, with the performance footage beautifully shot and edited. We'd knock director Earle Sebastian for a few too many tilted camera angles, but then we might have to wait another  19&nbsp;years for the next one.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I5XD06", "B00HUQC442", "B00KGFGJGS", "B00HUQC3U2", "B00004YX39", "B008O9V4C2", "B00005QBZD", "B000002MIY", "B0000936MD", "B000ZOSMTW", "B0038QGXMC", "B0050JN8BE", "B000002L42", "B0002IQI2Y", "B000E5N62U", "B00003002D", "B00000IPAB", "630463949X", "B00003002C", "B008B3MZMY", "B00HUGK78M", "B000002KXV", "B00JPUUPLA", "B00000DI0I", "B00KF1CWF0", "B00023P4B0", "B00002ND7R", "B00000IPAC", "B00000DI0J", "B005MXQD0G", "B000G73U5Y", "B00JQPOYAC", "B0001WANWW", "B0003035CW", "B00092ZMDY", "B003PBYT62", "0670025518", "B000053VAB", "B0016KJS3I", "B000BF0DCE", "B00005U122", "B007XNAPJS", "B0094P2SA2", "B00B7IJCZS", "B00CG0YLGG", "B00008PX8P", "B002CGS00C", "B0007Y89ZM", "B000654YRY", "B0018AK9NO", "B00023B1A8", "B0050JN7Z6", "B000069HQ8", "B0018LMZOO", "B0053TWUXI", "B0007GADZE", "B005ORVN1Y", "B0006A9GSG", "B004EKP5TS", "B00B7IJC9O", "B00FFLBXJQ", "B006T8KT6M", "B005V4X8TK", "B0001MDQ44", "B0018M6J72", "B00FLDG5BE", "B007FZ7NEE", "B0000D0YT4", "B00CA4S2PO", "B001XJEKGC", "B00J4A27B2", "6305019681", "B000P7V45S", "B000051Y2R", "B000N3SOSY", "B000BTC5LW", "B0043E8Y48", "B000002L2L", "B004GF244K", "B001DWNUF6", "B001NP8PQM", "B000A2RRF4", "B00EL6NWG8", "B00065MDSG", "B0018CWWLE", "B000056MMD", "B009E3EY38", "B000002OHR", "B001NP8PRG", "B00000J7S8", "B005JS7VTQ", "B0027WNRK4", "1573300934", "B004FRVE18", "B00B5DWH0W", "B00001ODGR", "B00EWV68SG", "B000AYQJ3I", "B00EL6NWT0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HUQC3U2", "B000I5XD06", "B000ZOSMTW", "B0038QGXMC"]}, "price": 8.91, "categories": [["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Vocal Jazz"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Soft Rock"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock"], ["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 73385}, "asin": "6305846464", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517T8W49QPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Steely Dan - Two Against Nature - DTS 5.1"}
{"description": "Noted for intimate character studies created in collaboration with his actors, director Mike Leigh makes a dramatic change of pace with this biography of comic opera composers W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is an easily angered but otherwise emotionally remote lyricist who works in collaboration with composer Sullivan (Alan Corduner), a genial and fun-loving sort who feels unsatisfied writing light operettas and longs to work with more serious material. While Sullivan is having a creative crisis, Gilbert is facing a failing marriage to Lucy (Lesley Manville), who loves her husband even if he can't return her affections, and must deal with his ailing father (Charles Simon). When they suffer their first failure, both men are depressed, and Sullivan announces that he's giving up operetta for good. However, a visit to an exhibit of Japanese art sparks an idea in Gilbert, and soon he and Sullivan are hard at work on what will become one of their greatest successes, The Mikado. Much of the film is devoted to the staging of this classic, with Shirley Henderson, Dorothy Atkinson, Martin Savage, Timothy Spall, and Kevin McKidd as members of the operetta's cast.

{"description": "Generally acknowledged as a bona fide classic, this Francis Ford Coppola film is one of those rare experiences that feels perfectly right from beginning to end--almost as if everyone involved had been born to participate in it. Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel about a Mafia dynasty, Coppola'sGodfatherextracted and enhanced the most universal themes of immigrant experience in America: the plotting-out of hopes and dreams for one's successors, the raising of children to carry on the good work, etc. In the midst of generational strife during the Vietnam years, the film somehow struck a chord with a nation fascinated by the metamorphosis of a rebellious son (Al Pacino) into the keeper of his father's dream. Marlon Brando played against Puzo's own conception of patriarch Vito Corleone, and time has certainly proven the actor correct. The rest of the cast, particularly James Caan, John Cazale, and Robert Duvall as the rest of Vito's male brood--all coping with how to take the mantle of responsibility from their father--is seamless and wonderful.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["630021639X", "6302158176", "6300183211", "6304214502", "6300214826", "0790705141", "6303168507", "0790733927", "B00003CXE6", "630470786X", "6300267997", "0790741512", "6303471501", "6300271331", "6302054982", "6303686796", "B00005PJ8I", "B00004COR2", "0792842111", "6304258984", "6304509146", "0783216084", "6300215644", "6300216500", "B000062XM6", "0800199421", "B0002F6BQU", "0800116917", "630336568X", "6304508611", "B00000F13T", "6304935811", "6305363668", "B000005PFL", "6300182878", "0792116887", "6300182452", "B00005B238", "0792845684", "6300247171", "0792839846", "6302482712", "6302989787", "0790732017", "0800100832", "630442972X", "6304196954", "B000065U6Q", "6301208773", "B00000K2SC", "6302842263", "6304429274", "6303313345", "B0000A36J1", "B000059XY5", "079212569X"], "bought_together": ["630021639X", "6302158176"], "also_viewed": ["6302610702", "630021639X", "6301792734", "6303402348", "6300215830", "6304117752", "6300183211", "6302158176", "B00COYZF5A", "6300214060", "B000NTPDSW", "6305095566", "0792151712", "6305169187", "6303953425", "080010367X", "6302054982", "6301208773", "B000KX0ISG", "630310696X", "6302415853", "6304214502", "B00005B238", "6303168507", "B00E9PMMX0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 270877}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.98, "brand": "", "asin": "B000003KHS", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11KQ3QC757L.jpg", "title": "The Godfather [VHS]"}

{"description": "There's no rule against rock anthems from the 1970s in the soundtrack for a movie about a medieval jousting champion, but if you're going to attempt such jarring anachronisms, you'd better establish acceptable ground rules. Writer-director Brian Helgeland does precisely that inA Knight's Taleand pulls off this trick with such giddy aplomb that you can't help but play along. (Upon witnessing a crowd of peasants at a jousting match, singing and clapping to the beat of Queen's \"We Will Rock You,\" you're either going to love this movie or dismiss it altogether.) Other vintage rock hits will follow, but Helgeland--the Oscar&#xAE;-winning cowriter ofL.A. Confidential--handles this ploy with judicious goodwill, in what is an otherwise honest period piece about a peasant named William (Heath Ledger) who rises by grit and determination to the hallowed status of knighthood.As if the soundtrack weren't audacious enough, Helgeland (recovering from the sour experience of his directorial debut,Payback) casts none other than Geoffrey Chaucer (wonderfully played by Paul Bettany) as William's cohort and match announcer, along with William's pals Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), and feisty blacksmith Kate (Laura Fraser). Of course there must be a fair maiden, and she is Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon), with whom William falls in love while battling the nefarious Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) on the European jousting circuit. Add to this an inspiring father-son reunion, Ledger's undeniable charisma, a perfect supporting cast, and enough joyful energy to rejuvenate the film's formulaic plot, andA Knight's Talebecomes that most pleasant of movie surprises--an unlikely winner that rises up, like its hero, to exceed all expectations.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EDWKXI", "0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00006ZXSK", "B004SEUIWY", "B002VWNID6", "B00004XPPG", "B00003CXC3", "B00005EBIL", "B000ARXF96", "B00AEFXKUI", "B004SUDQ40", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9U6", "0792839137", "B0002YLCG0", "B003UYUQZW", "B003FCKIGQ", "B000056VP4", "B002NZK5V4", "B00005JLO2", "B002O3Z50Q", "B002O3Z4XY", "B00AEFY5B6", "B000GGSMO4", "6305428077", "B00003CXG7", "B00004WG2F", "B00005JN0T", "B0010V4VJY", "B005ORVN00", "B00000JQB5", "6305428042", "6305123454", "0783225814", "B00AEBB9UU", "6305692688", "B0000WN0SW", "B000MGUZCU", "B00006ADFM", "B00005JKCH", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0000TPA0G", "B0000844I8", "B002GHHHHO", "0783240295", "B000K7VHQ4", "B00000K3UU", "B00005JKMN", "B000EPFCPE", "B0006GAI5U", "B0007IO6NM", "B002K0WBXW", "0767821513", "B00005QJJG", "B00008EYA5", "B00004Z4WR", "B00005JKNV", "B00005LOL0", "B004SIP6BI", "B00003CXHJ", "B002NXSRVG", "B002ZG999U", "B004SEUJ9Q", "0783233477", "B000T5O47Q", "B00F84H73Q", "B003U0AHBO", "B00004W4UD", "B00AEFXYOA", "B000AARKOO", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00005JM5B", "B0001HLVS2", "6305428387", "B002GHHHME", "B000LC55F2", "B00AEBB8R4", "B007SPPANM", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00BLN4V46", "B000EGDB10", "0800195175", "B000FKO5QK", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00BTYSIWI", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305609764", "B000K4WPCC", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B00011CZRE", "B00005JMOW", "0800141741", "B00005JPD0", "B001DDBD4K", "B00008G7UF", "B000209KMW", "1558908382", "B004LWZWGA", "B0009RCPUW"], "bought_together": ["B00447L4KA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0800141601", "B00447L4KA", "B00003CXC3"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7604}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.99, "brand": "Columbia Telecommunications", "asin": "B00000F4ZY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNtZ4oMwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Manhunter:Though it will always be remembered as the movie featuring the \"other\" Hannibal Lecter, Michael Mann's 1986 thrillerManhunteris nearly as good asThe Silence of the Lambs, and in some respects it's arguably even better. Based on Thomas Harris's novelRed Dragon, which introduced the world to the nefarious killer Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter, the film stars William Petersen (giving a suitably brooding performance) as ex-FBI agent Will Graham, who is coaxed out of semiretirement to track down a serial killer who has thwarted the authorities at every turn.Graham's approach to the case is a perilous one. First he seeks counsel with Lecter (Brian Cox) in the latter's high-security prison cell--an encounter that is utterly horrifying in its psychological effect--and then he begins to mold his own psyche to that of the killer, with potentially devastating results. As directed by Mann (who was at the acme of his success with TV'sMiami Vice), this sophisticated cat-and-mouse game never resorts to the compromise of cheap thrills. Predating Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Lecter by four years, Cox plays the character closer to Harris's original, lower-key conception, and he's no less compelling in the role. Petersen is equally well cast, and as always Mann employs rock music to astonishing effect, using nearly all of Iron Butterfly's heavy-metal epic \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" to accompany the film's heart-stopping climactic sequence. All of this makesManhunterone of the finest films of its kind, as well as further proof that Harris's fiction is a blessing to any filmmaker brave enough to adapt it. --Jeff ShannonThe Silence of the Lambs: Based on Thomas Harris's novel, this terrifying film by Jonathan Demme really only contains a couple of genuinely shocking moments (one involving an autopsy, the other a prison break). The rest of the film is a splatter-free visual and psychological descent into the hell of madness, redeemed astonishingly by an unlikely connection between a monster and a haunted young woman. Anthony Hopkins is extraordinary as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, virtually entombed in a subterranean prison for the criminally insane. At the behest of the FBI, agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) approaches Lecter, requesting his insights into the identity and methods of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). In exchange, Lecter demands the right to penetrate Starling's most painful memories, creating a bizarre but palpable intimacy that liberates them both under separate but equally horrific circumstances. Demme, a filmmaker with a uniquely populist vision (Melvin and Howard,Something Wild), also spent his early years making pulp for Roger Corman (Caged Heat), and he hasn't forgotten the significance of tone, atmosphere, and the unsettling nature of a crudely effective close-up. Much of the film, in fact, consists of actors staring straight into the camera (usually from Clarice's point of view), making every bridge between one set of eyes to another seem terribly dangerous. --Tom KeoghHannibal: Yes, he's back, and he's still hungry. Ten years afterThe Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Hannibal \"the Cannibal\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins, reprising his Oscar-winning role) is living the good life in Italy, studying art and sipping espresso. FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster), on the other hand, hasn't had it so good--an outsider from the start, she's now a quiet, moody loner who doesn't play bureaucratic games and suffers for it. A botched drug raid results in her demotion--and a request from Lecter's only living victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, uncredited), for a little Q and A. Little does Clarice realize that the hideously deformed Verger--who, upon suggestion from Dr. Lecter, peeled off his own face--is using her as bait to lure Dr. Lecter out of hiding, quite certain he'll capture the good doctor.Taking the basic plot contraptions from Thomas Harris's baroque novel,Hannibalis so stylistically different from its predecessor that it forces you to take it on its own terms. Director Ridley Scott gives the film a sleek, almost European look that lets you know that, unlike the first film (which was about the quintessentially American Clarice), this movie is all Hannibal. Does it work? Yes--but only up to a point. Scott adeptly sets up an atmosphere of foreboding, but it's all buildup for anticlimax, as Verger's plot for abducting Hannibal (and feeding him to man-eating wild boars) doesn't really deliver the requisite visceral thrills, and the much-ballyhooed climatic dinner sequence between Clarice, Dr. Lecter, and a third unlucky guest wobbles between parody and horror. Hopkins and Moore are both first-rate, but the film contrives to keep them as far apart as possible, when what madeSilenceso amazing was their interaction. When they do connect it's quite thrilling, but it's unfortunately too little too late. --Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO", "B000GFLEBI", "B00CWIMVDW", "B000R4SMCW", "B00011CZRE", "B00FYJ6P06", "0425228223", "B000HEWEGC", "B00003CXSP", "B00079Z9WI", "B003W5C0VC", "0312924585", "0440224675", "B0009A40ES", "B002VWNIDG", "B0087ZG7UW", "044024286X", "0783240295", "B000HCO86I", "B000Q66Q8I", "B000U1ZV8K", "B00DTPRZ24", "B002NZK5RI", "B000P0J09M", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP95G", "B004LWZW2O", "B005CFBYW6", "B0002JP572", "B000V4UFZK", "B0018CMJSU", "B0052XU4BK", "B008R65XYC", "B000BRBA9C", "B000Q66Q2O", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00005K3NZ", "B00005N5S5", "B002XD0J80", "B0006GANOQ", "B0033B5XCS", "073948253X", "B00AEFYGBA", "B001AS7VQM", "B003HKN52U", "B003XURDAY", "B002VWNIEA", "B000UGBOT0", "B000E8M0P6", "B005CFC0N8", "B00AEBB89W", "B006NXW4EI", "B003PIUIIS", "B00000ILDG", "B004FQX5B6", "B00009W5CA", "B002KH4KSY", "B000RIWAVW", "6305622760", "B002XMGGK6", "B000LP6KNU", "B002YICNE2", "B004LWZW42", "0767830555", "B003UGLCIA", "B000RRS7RE", "B00AEFYYH6", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00006FDCD", "B0002C4JJ4", "B000BBOUW2", "B002GSXKN8", "B00JL6L4UY", "B00441GYZ6", "B003PIUINS", "B000FA57UI", "B00015YVDG", "B0000VCZK2", "B004EPYZO4", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEBB8NI", "B007D0FVRM", "B00DHD933W", "B007D5E7C2", "B00005V9HH", "B00151QYXU", "B000U1ZV6W", "B006X08FGW", "B00AP2DC94", "B000FS9FCG", "B000FS9FE4", "6305313687", "B0050MB4OO", "B0006HBZXS", "B0009RCPY8", "B00386EZUY", "B003IY498Y", "B0009X768W"], "bought_together": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005JLKN", "B000NVT0SO", "B000LP6KNU", "B00003CXSP"]}, "price": 23.32, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 51513}, "asin": "B00000G3R0", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51169H5FYEL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Hannibal Lecter Collection (Manhunter / The Silence of the Lambs / Hannibal)"}

{"description": "When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe withDuelin his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene ofSaving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds.A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance.The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winningSchindler's List, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.Saving Private Ryantouches us deeper thanSchindlerbecause it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00006C7G9", "6303168507", "6303057225", "B00AEBBA36", "6302529441", "0800125762", "6304935811", "B00003CXTF", "B000EHSVS2", "0790734060", "6303257844", "6302415853", "B0007TKNGA", "6301247345", "6301662954", "0790734079", "6302610702", "6302909023", "630407185X", "0783221347", "079213690X", "0800132009", "0790701251", "6305363668", "6301115430", "0790752395", "6304071876", "6300268748"], "bought_together": ["B00006C7G9"], "also_viewed": ["0792151712", "6301792734", "0792837614", "B00003CXXO", "6303109950", "6304117752", "6303402348", "6303168507", "B00003CXTF", "B000RC7QVC", "0783221347", "078323662X", "630018627X", "6304151306", "0783230095", "6304233639", "B0000040EJ", "6303187064"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 269908}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00000K3AM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4143F912CXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Saving Private Ryan [VHS]"}

{"description": "So who exactly was Deep Throat, that all-important source who helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bust open the Watergate scandal? Well, according to this thoroughly funny, keenly smart comedy from director Andrew Fleming (The Craft), it was two sweetly daft teenage girls named Betsy and Arlene. Taking the history and figures from Watergate and running gleefully and sacrilegiously amok,Dickoffers up a hilarious what-if scenario that takes the Nixon administration's downfall from grave tragedy to hilarious farce. When Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) run into a shady figure in the stairwell of Arlene's Watergate apartment building, little do they know they've stumbled upon G.&nbsp;Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) on the night of the Democratic National Headquarters break-in. Later, on a White House field trip, they wind up meeting with Nixon himself (Dan Hedaya), who, to ensure their silence, decides to make them official White House dog walkers and \"secret youth advisors.\" Of course, Betsy and Arlene soon find out their idol has feet of clay, and ultimately decide to aid \"radical muckraking journalists\" (and queasy rivals) Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein (Bruce McCullough) in their investigation. Fleming and cowriter Sheryl Longin's enfolding of the Watergate scandal is extremely clever and inspired, from Arlene's 18-and-a-half-minute declaration of love on Nixon's tape recorder to the Hello Dolly cookies (laced with a certain herbal stimulant) that help bring about the U.S.-Soviet accord. And after all the angsty-serious portraits of Watergate, it's bliss to see the prime players sent up mercilessly; in addition to Shearer, the cast boasts Dave Foley (Erlichman), Jim Breuer (John Dean), Saul Rubinek (Kissinger), and Ana Gasteyer (Rosemary Woods), all in fine form. Hedaya's Nixon, dead-on but never parodic, is an Oscar-worthy comic turn, and Dunst and Williams invest their characters with affection and humor; the success of the film lies in the way these talented actresses make us laughwithBetsy and Arlene, never at them. Don't be put off by the teen sheen on this comedy--it's also for all of us who still remember Watergate even after 25 years, and still love dancing on the scandal's grave.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["6303057942"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 509409}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B000021Y7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517TQG3CXVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dick [VHS]"}

{"description": "Mounted in high lavish style, from the opening strains to coda,The Red Violinpays homage to the careful uses of color and composition without bothering to support these qualities with any real substance. Oh, it's a class act on the surface all the way, while failing on nearly every other level to convince. The story tells the story, revealing precious little else. The 17th-century Cremonese instrument-maker Niccolo  Bussotti finishes his final violin with a curious red varnish, the secret of which spans the film, yet will come as a surprise only to the very sleepy. The odd voyage of this unique violin through history is then explored from one episode to the next, from child prodigy to gypsies to Victorian virtuoso to a clandestine enclave of art lovers in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution. This is all framed by  the violin's rediscovery in present day by instrument appraiser Charles Morritz (Samuel&nbsp;L. Jackson), for whom the perfect instrument strikes a resonant chord. The main scheme of the film, an object connecting a number of seemingly disparate stories, has been used many times, most notably in Max Ophuls'sLa Ronde. But while this approach is employed elsewhere to cause one scene to reverberate against another,The Red Violinis content to leave each episode thematically unconnected with any of the others. On the decorative level, the film may satisfy many viewers with its sensuous attention to tone and detail, as well as its eclectic and expertly  performedscore. But as  narrative it is very slight.

{"description": "As the triumphant start of a trilogy,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringleaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter  Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classicThe Lord of the Rings,  but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation,  instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178  minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth,  the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and  humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo  (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous  journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film  is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production  design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure. Ending on  a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation, this wondrous fantasy  continues inThe Two Towers(2002).--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B005COPWZW", "B00005JM5E", "B002ZG980U", "B002PMV9FG", "B001GZ6QC4", "B007K3JFUQ", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JNJV", "B001OQCV6A", "B004M1A21K", "B008UZ7MYY", "B00HFFE8HE", "B000A9QKLO", "B000E8M0VA", "B000W7F5SS", "B0014C2FX8", "0618640150", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2M6I", "B00003CX5P", "B0013FDM7E", "B00AZMFJYA", "B00005QZWI", "B0019L770A", "B000I0RQVI", "B002IPFWTE", "B001CDR1FG", "B0006UEVT0", "B003TT2X6S", "B001OQCV2E", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JL78", "B00005JNOG", "B001UV4XHY", "B00CNW9ZI6", "B00GKOJ98E", "0345325818", "B0014Z4ON4", "B000H30B2C", "B005LXQLRW", "B001UV4XIS", "B001GCUO1Q", "B00CZDLGDU", "0345538374", "B004LWZW42", "B007REV4T8", "B000W746GK", "B00005JPH2", "B003TT2X72", "B004LWZWGA", "B0087ZG7J8", "B005G4TJUC", "B003ZK99NQ", "B00006HBUJ", "B008UZA8FY", "B0090SI56Y", "B000VI70QS", "B00005JNC2", "B004WCTLNY", "B0014Z4OMU", "6305313687", "B004AKCME8", "B000E6EK2Y", "0547928211", "B000LC55F2", "B0002KVUKM", "B000FQJAIW", "B008JFUO72", "B000FIMG68", "B005LAIHSG", "B005LAIIT4", "B004AOECXI", "B00029RTCG", "B000P0J0EM", "B002HWRYJE", "B0060FXDCG", "B001ECQ75A", "0792839749", "B00AEFXZJE", "B005LAII0I", "B0042U94UQ", "B001HN6918", "B00008G8M5", "B008JFURII", "B003ZKBELG", "B000P0J09W", "B003XURDAY", "B00335EQ0E", "B00008G8M4", "0547928203", "B000W796OM", "B00006ADD5", "B00J49R1BY", "B00B04NIZO", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00001ZWUS"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKZV", "B00005JKZY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HFFE8HE", "B00005JKZY", "B00BEZTMFY", "B00005JKZV"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 3641}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.49, "brand": "NEW Line Home Video", "asin": "B00003CWT6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj%2BQ1hLBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Two-Disc Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"}

Oscar nominee Joan Allan joins Lurie, turning the commentary track into an enjoyable conversation. It tends to be a lovefest at times but does give insight into the relationship between a lead actor and director during filmmaking. Over the end credits, Lurie mentions the brouhaha that actor (and producer) Gary Oldman started when he made discouraging comments about the film's final cut. It's interesting to note none of Oldman's work ends up in the dozen deleted scenes shown on the DVD. The scenes have much more meat on the bone than most and illustrate some curious character development.

{"description": "Hong Kongwuxiafilms, or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watchingwuxiafilms as a youngster and madeCrouching Tigeras a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer,The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work onThe Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.The filming required an immense effort from all involved. Chow and Yeoh had to learn to speak Mandarin, which Lee insisted on using instead of Cantonese to achieve a more classic, lyrical feel. The astonishing battles between Jen (Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) on the rooftops and Jen and Li Mu Bai (Chow) atop the branches of bamboo trees required weeks of excruciating wire and harness work (which in turn required meticulous \"digital wire removal\"). But the result is a seamless blend of action, romance, and social commentary in a populist film that, like its young star Zhang, soars with balletic grace and dignity.--Eugene Wei", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0007QS27K"], "also_viewed": ["B0007Q6VXC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 367958}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 0.95, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXR3", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G39T50SDL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]"}

{"description": "To callPearl Harbora throwback to old-time war movies is something of an understatement. Director Michael Bay's epic take on the bombing that brought the United States into World War II hijacks every war movie situation and clich&#xE9; (some affectionate, some stale) you've ever seen and gives them a shiny, glossy spin until the whole movie practically gleams. Planes glisten, water sparkles, trees beckon--and Bay's re-creation of the bombing itself, a 30-minute sequence that's tightly choreographed and amazingly photographed, sets the action movie bar up quite a few notches. And in updating the classic war film, Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) use that old plot standby, the love triangle--this time, it's between two pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who find themselves stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during what they thought would be a nice, sunny tour of duty. Then, of course, history intervened.For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress--he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance--the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England--works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo fromTitanic(a strategy the film strives hard toward), but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else inPearl Harbor--from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR--is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold,Pearl Harboris quite a thrilling ride.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792151712", "B000059HGY", "B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36", "0792133153", "079212569X", "6305169187", "6301734734", "0792147618", "0792116887", "6304618344", "079213690X", "6303269834", "6304925131", "6305718792", "6304259131", "B00004WIDB", "6304935811", "6303057225", "6304143184", "6302250269"], "bought_together": ["B00000K3AN", "B00AEBBA36"], "also_viewed": ["B00000G3PA", "0792151712", "6300213668", "B00000JS61", "6303215734", "6303402348", "B00004WIDB", "079213690X", "6305750750", "B004751DFU", "B00005O893", "B00000K3AN", "6301792734", "B00E5I2MCM", "6305169187", "B00007LVCM", "B007SPPANM", "B00L4K3MLE", "B00FLML7HW", "B008QZ5PY2", "B00JBGWP3Y"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 234413}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.49, "brand": "", "asin": "B00003CXTF", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HC1ZDJN6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pearl Harbor (Two-Videotape Set) (60th Anniversay Commemorative Edition) [VHS]"}
{"description": "LikeSaving Private Ryan,Enemy at the Gatesopens with a  pivotal event of World War II--the German invasion of  Stalingrad--re-created in epic scale, as ill-trained Russian soldiers  face German attack or punitive execution if they flee from the enemy's  advance. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures this madness with urgent  authenticity, creating a massive context for a more intimate battle  waged amid the city's ruins. Embellished from its basis in fact, the  story shifts to an intense cat-and-mouse game between a Russian shepherd  raised to iconic fame and a German marksman whose skill is unmatched in  its lethal precision. Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) has been sniping Nazis  one bullet at a time, while the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) has been  assigned to kill Vassily and spare Hitler from further embarrassment.There's love in war as Vassily connects with a woman soldier (Rachel  Weisz), but she is also loved by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the Soviet  officer who promotes his friend Vassily as Russia's much-needed hero.  This romantic rivalry lends marginal interest to the central plot, but  it's not enough to make this a classic war film. Instead it's a taut,  well-made suspense thriller isolated within an epic battle, and although  Annaud and cowriter Alain Godard (drawing from William Craig's book and  David L. Robbins's novelThe War of the Rats) fail to connect  the parallel plots with any lasting impact, the production is never less  than impressive. Highly conventional but handled with intelligence and  superior craftsmanship, this is warfare as strategic entertainment,  without compromising warfare as a manmade hell on Earth.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B004U7MQWY", "B00AEBBA36", "B00001ZWUS", "B0007KIFGE", "B000065U1N", "B0015D20FE", "B001KZOUU0", "B00005PJ8T", "079284646X", "B001TUZG4K", "B00005JPKE", "B000095WW8", "B00003CXHJ", "B009XTF8NI", "0792839730", "B000M4RG42", "B00005JK8K", "B000P0J09C", "B00275EGWY", "B00003CXTG", "B003ASLJOU", "B003ELKNH2", "B000EHSVSC", "B004C45AZU", "B00AEFXKUI", "B00004XPPG", "0142000000", "B0007TKNGA", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00B0U2SFE", "B00005N5S3", "B00005PJ8S", "B00AEFYBA6", "B00006CXSS", "B00005ASGB", "B002ZG97RE", "B0007TKNLA", "0767802470", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00A34LX2M", "B00AEFY0F2", "0767817745", "B001LMAK9M", "B0000542CK", "B005LAIGYQ", "B000EHSVS2", "B00AEBB86U", "B00D3XMA9A", "B0000714C4", "B000XR9L50", "B000H1RFSM", "B005E2YL3Q", "B004TXFFI6", "6304698747", "0792838041", "B00008AOTR", "B000ELL1R6", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B000E5N63Y", "B000YBKO6U", "B00BY0EBK0", "6305558167", "B002O3Z50Q", "B00005PJ8K", "B006TTC5HC", "B0007TKNM4", "B00AEFY4IA", "6304765258", "B00AEBB86A", "B000DZIGDU", "B000FVQLRA", "B00AEFY5B6", "6305692688", "B002CPMB9O", "B00AMSLDTM", "B0000TANUI", "B00JA3RVG4", "B004SIP6QI", "B000O599YO", "B000MZHW40", "B00004XPPC", "0792838408", "B007HCI42A", "B0009RCPUC", "B00005B6JZ", "B0002YLCG0", "B00CZB9BE8", "B002O3Z510", "B00005OSJQ", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00005QAQI", "B000CNESN0", "B00008AOTO", "B005DKS1TE", "B00DL48BM6", "0792841662", "B0001NBMH6", "B0001FGC1U", "6304711891"], "bought_together": ["B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00001ZWUS", "B00AEFXRRO", "B00AEBBA36", "B00HEPE6MM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 22765}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 11.69, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B00003CXRA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510oEAHvU8L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Enemy at the Gates"}

{"description": "Sistersis not Brian De Palma's first film, but in many ways it is the first Brian De Palma film, or at least the first to reveal (and revel in) his affinity with Hitchcock. A pre-SupermanMargot Kidder struggles with a French-Canadian accent as an aspiring actress whose one-night stand leads to a homicidal morning-after. Jennifer Salt is a reporter with more moxie than tact or skill who sees the killing from her apartment window across the way. When the police fail to turn up any evidence of the crime, Salt investigates with a private eye (the hilariously relentless Charles Durning), uncovering the secret story of a pair of Siamese twins and a weaselly, stalker doctor. It's a mystery simmering in a stew of voyeurism, guilt, sex, and obsession. De Palma borrows fromRear Window,Psycho, andVertigo(as well as Roman Polanski'sRepulsion), and composer Bernard Herrmann quotes from his own Hitchcock scores (notablyPsycho) for the unsettling music, but the result is more original than you might imagine. Laced with dark humor, inventive technique, and impressive technical precision (the split-screen sequences are breathtakingly effective), De Palma flexes his cinematic muscles with thrilling results, right down to the mordantly wry conclusion. De Palma graduated to big-budget thrillers, but this modest little production remains one of his sharpest, slyest, most engrossing films. Long available only in pallid video transfers, the Home Vision/Criterion letterboxed restoration is bright, clear, and beautiful.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005K3NU", "B003TTBA0S", "B00005K3NV", "B00005LIRC", "B000H5TH1Q", "B00005LIRB", "B0058O1FES", "B00GOT15IM", "B0009298N4", "0783228449", "B000S0GYRK", "B0009GX1CE", "B00005NFZC", "B004JPJHL0", "B000IMUYJM", "B00062IVJ4", "B00HVOFP12", "B0007GAG42", "B00K1L4NBU", "B00IGK6T9W", "B000S0GYRU", "B00GBT62PQ", "0780022629", "B004QIT2X8", "B00HRISNPM", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00JQYV0B4", "B004KDYR20", "B00GPPXNLC", "B00L3ZB7JO", "B0056ANHCM", "B00ARWX9NG", "B000069I09", "B000MX7V3O", "B00ITZXDDY", "B0002V7O0Q", "B00F98FOI6", "B00K6D1S7A", "B00IA1VQBS", "B0009HMTKI", "B000NOK0GW", "B004ALIG4W", "B0002JP2OS", "B0026VBOJ2", "B00EVU3S4U", "B0001ZX0GU", "B0002KPHZG", "B00009PY2T", "B004FUPK6U", "B00K72HVBC", "B00005BCK0", "B0001XAKUQ", "B00004Z1FM", "B002AMVEII", "B002U6DVPI", "B000CR76U8", "B00005U2KC", "B00007ELDG", "B001B9ZVVC", "B00HE011DE", "B000ELL1R6", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00DZP1C9K", "B00BOWOBTO", "069220315X", "B005152C78", "B00HZVX14O", "B00GHH9GSC", "0790776960", "B0089LT7ZG", "B00005JMVQ", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00HRUQB8Q", "B00HGBAG5K", "B001152TL6", "B00AQ6J5JU", "B001J710Y8", "B00005M2C7", "B003WKL6YO", "B0000633SD", "B00180R06I", "B000069CF9", "B00006FMCS", "B0002KQNKE", "B00B2BYXTK", "B004ALIG4M", "B003KGBIRK", "B005152C9G", "B00HT2RTU6", "B000TSIJWY", "B00JPUUSSU", "B00BCMT2BI", "B004ALIG1U", "1559409002", "B00000JT2R", "B00GPPXP6A", "B001BEK8F6", "B0002VYOVS", "B00012L77W", "B001D8W7CW"], "bought_together": ["B003TTBA0S", "B00005K3NU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005K3NV", "B00005K3NU", "B003TTBA0S", "B000H5TH1Q"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 82876}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 20.59, "brand": "Image Entertainment", "asin": "B00004W3HG", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R9QXTNP9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sisters (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "What can be more enjoyable then a meal among friends and family?  In Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's surrealistic comedyThe Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisieit is this common ritual a sextet of upper-class friends repeatedly attempt, only to be obstructed by one obscure event after another. Masterfully balancing the dichotomy of class vs. debauchery Bu&ntilde;uel delivers a ripping critique of the upper class. It is clear from the beginning that the lives Bu&ntilde;uel&#x92;sBourgeoisieare living are not what they seem.  Eventually, their true colors begin to shine; not in actual actions but in haunting dreams. What is real and what lies in the subconscious becoming exceedingly blurry and in order to deliver his message, surrealism must take over. It is hard to pigeonhole Bu&ntilde;uel&#x92;s classic that won him the Oscar forBest Foreign Language Film 1972: An absurd odyssey? A discreet satire?

{"description": "While more cautious fans may want to pick and choose among the previously released individual volumes ofMonty Pythonfor their collection, true Pythonites will want to own this definitive, 14-volume DVD-only boxed set that contains all 45 episodes (in chronological order) ofMonty Python's Flying Circus. This \"persistently silly\" collection encompasses three-and-a-half seasons of dead parrots, cross-dressing lumberjacks, loonies, upper class twits, and spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, baked beans, spam, spam, and spam. Click past the occasional clunker and go directly to such signature sketches as the Ministry of Silly Walks, the Spanish Inquisition, the Fish-Slapping Dance, the Dead Parrot Sketch, the Lumberjack Song, the Cheese Shop, the Argument Clinic, and Nudge, Nudge. Taken as a whole, one marvels at how Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam thoroughly subverted television convention with \"something completely different,\" like sketches with no punch lines (\"Your average TV viewer isn't going to understand this\").A warning to the uninitiated: there is much \"material that some may find offensive, but which is really smashing.\" Violations of something called the \"Strange Sketch Act\" are the least of the troupe's offenses, as witness the Oscar Wilde Sketch, the Dirty Vicar Sketch, and the Most Awful Family in Britain Sketch, all of which achieve \"the really gross awfulness\" all Python fans are looking for.

{"description": "\"I'm gonna scare the hell out of you,\" intones Stephen King in the trailer for his sole directorial effort, the much-malignedMaximum Overdrive. While the end result doesn't live up to that boast, this sci-fi/horror tale isn't as awful as it's been described. King's script (based on his short story \"Trucks\") focuses on the patrons of a North Carolina truck stop, which comes under attack by a convoy of trucks and other machines animated by Earth's passage through the tail of a \"rogue comet.\" King's fans, tired of half-baked screen adaptations likeCujoandChildren of the Corn, expected a horror home run fromMaximum Overdriveand instead got an old-fashioned drive-in movie filled with car crashes, cheapjack gore, and fart jokes. Needless to say, they stayed away in droves; the film's failure helped ruin producer Dino De Laurentiis's DEG Films and forced King to sheepishly claim that he had created a modern-dayPlan Nine from Outer Space. While the film is torpidly paced and often amateurishly acted, it's no worse than any direct-to-video thriller, and King's ear for dialogue occasionally shines through the gloom. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle register as a heroic cook and his black-hearted boss, respectively; the cast includes Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson's voice), Giancarlo Esposito, and Marla Maples (!) as a victim. Anchor Bay's letterboxed print is the R-rated theatrical version; the film was cut extensively after receiving an X rating for violence. The original trailer and a thorough biography on King are also included.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B000G1R39E", "B0013527K2", "6305645574", "B00006FDCU", "B0030BOCL4", "B0001FVDQ4", "B006J8NPAE", "B00A1AU72A", "B00006FDCD", "B0002A2VK0", "B0007WFXNA", "B000053UIF", "B00005UQ9V", "6304936397", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000068IES", "B00AEBB91E", "B00BW4S87U", "B000063UR5", "1573625779", "B00JF5GAIW", "0792841328", "B000AYELI8", "B000U1ZV6W", "B00009OWI3", "B0010X73ZG", "B00AEBB91O", "1573626910", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00BTYPW7C", "0767821599", "B005CFBZVG", "B001DZOC64", "0783228686", "B0053TWVDC", "B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEFYV9W", "1573623911", "B00000F3SB", "B0052XU4BK", "0790742829", "B0053TWW9K", "B000063JDM", "B002KH4KSY", "B002NZK5SM", "B000GYI340", "B00AEFY37C", "B002WDR4AC", "B000063US5", "B0053TWV46", "B003L2M584", "B0007NFMB2", "B0002OXVG4", "B000069I05", "B00AEFXR8I", "B00AKGG828", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00005RDAI", "630523650X", "0792842960", "B008A1TUW0", "B002GHHHH4", "B0052SO0LK", "6304604572", "B0053TWVA0", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0084MVE7E", "B000MDFTHE", "B00005K3NR", "B00008WT5J", "B00APQLJTA", "6305756430", "B00006CXGP", "6305238065", "B00AEFXPG2", "B000H4JH7Q", "B002GHHHG0", "B006BZ8NSE", "B0002V7O3I", "B004AC6PMG", "B002WJHBE0", "157362408X", "B005OK0YVG", "B0033HKCV4", "B008DL4KZY", "B00005N5RM", "B00BW4S89S", "B00006RCOC", "B003VA3JUO", "B005LS4MQY", "B00AEFY31S", "B005DL6PLY", "B00005O439", "B00JVQ7PWU", "B00GJNQ4M0", "B00009PY4C"], "bought_together": ["B0002O7XW2", "B0013527K2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WDR4AC", "6305120021", "B0002O7XW2", "B00A1AU72A"]}, "price": 79.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 111118}, "asin": "B0000509C5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M1301NVNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Maximum Overdrive"}
{"description": "Clean-cut kid Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius) is framed and executed for the brutal murder of his girlfriend (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe). He is revived by a crow spirit guide to hunt down the corrupt policemen who committed the crime, and ultimately to unmask the mysterious scarred man who ordered her death. The macabre noirish spin James O'Barr's original graphic novels put on the superhero mythos translated reasonably well for the original film of the series, directed by Alex Proyas in 1994 and starring the late Brandon Lee. But the premise had already worn thin by the first sequel, 1996'sThe Crow: City of Angels, and this entry simply rehashes the same story (tragic hero in clown greasepaint avenges beautiful dead girlfriend by eliminating outlandish villains) without adding anything new to the mix. Mabius brings nothing to the role except boyish good looks, while Kirsten Dunst is wasted in a supporting role as the murdered girl's sister. The supporting cast includes career cad William Atherton as Dunst's red-handed dad, and Fred Ward as a police captain with a taste for recreational surgery. Director Bharat Nalluri (the minor U.K. cult picKilling Time, 1998) ably handles the action scenes and faux postindustrial atmosphere but seems at odds with how to pace or stage dialogue scenes (not thatX-Filesscribe Chip Johannesson's script provides any worth the effort). Gore effects courtesy the KNB Group and a Sturm und Drang soundtrack featuring Kid Rock, Hole, and others will help hold the most loyal fans' interest.--Paul Gaita", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004P7CMDM", "B000059XUP", "B0007US7DA", "B0085A9HU6", "B008D1RDFS", "B000OCY7OO", "B005EY2XFC", "B004S699HC", "1451627254", "B004U7MQY2", "B0011367SY", "B00004NKBO", "B0056P6SOG", "B004U7MQYC", "B008874968", "B000BBOUW2", "B0010YVCAM", "B000099T3M", "B002GHHHOM", "6304712499", "B008OR5X4O", "B0016PWNFS", "B004P7CN7W", "B00860YHWI", "B005TK0MFE", "B005LAIGW8", "B00HXH00YE", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00AGKHC3C", "B000LC4Z7Q", "B00003CXPS", "B0001Z37HM", "B000SAGGSC", "B000FA57US", "B001W72VPW", "0878162216", "B0000D9PNG", "B0009X76XC", "B00HRYH7G2", "B000EQ5V8G", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B004EPYZT4", "B000RW5BZ0", "B001CDR1FG", "B000TGJ81W", "B00D97DMBU", "078401132X", "B008JFUS0U", "B00008G8M5", "B001MWUWU8", "B002ZG98UA", "B004LGGXG4", "B00AEFY37C", "B000069I1I", "B005G5NPD8", "B000ION23U", "078321958X", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00000I1KB", "B000VECACQ", "B003Y7F1JQ", "B00AEFY2LO", "B005CFBZQ6", "B004SIP8ES", "B00JL6L4WC", "B000002IWH", "B000067FP8", "B005OK722U", "B007XF0XUW", "B001AK3S4E", "B0009A409S", "B000059H98", "B00AJXO5X6", "B00GNAO70K", "B00DEQQK8S", "B003VQO4WU", "B004LWZW2O", "B004HGQMW8", "B00B96TGQS", "B002UJIY0C", "B00EF1PM2G", "B0001FR3IQ", "B002GSXKNI", "B003VE9WP6", "B00DMUFXOS", "B000053VBW", "B0052XU4BK", "B001GUYB08", "B00105303S", "0061058262", "B000A7Q1UQ", "B0002JP572", "B0041KKYCY", "B005LAIHYU", "B007IUED94", "B004WOAGG8", "B000FA57UI", "B00DTRR43W", "B000FFJ81C", "0792842960"], "bought_together": ["B0085A9HU6", "B000059XUP"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0085A9HU6", "B000059XUP", "B008D1RDFS", "B004P7CMDM"]}, "price": 47.94, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 150485}, "asin": "B0000524EB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JRSYDWKVL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Crow - Salvation (Dimension Collector's Series)"}

{"description": "There's a great film waiting to be made from the real-life Cain and Abel story of the Mitchell brothers, a story of decadence, drugs, and sex that ended in bloody fratricide. This, unfortunately, is not it. The San Francisco pornography pioneers created the crossover X-rated hitBehind the Green Door, took on both the government and the mob, and weathered the crash of porno theaters by turning their show palace into a venue for live sex shows. The brothers Mitchell were flamboyant showman, from black-tie movie premieres to high-profile arrests, and brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez play the media clowns with ease (under, it should be noted, some very unconvincing bald caps).Sheen brings a mix of boyish charm, sleepy-eyed irresponsibility, and welled-up rage to the part of Artie Mitchell, the younger brother full of ideas always in the shadow of Jim (Estevez), the director and media glory-hound. Behind the scenes, however, their lives are a repetitious loop of snorting, smoking, sex, and shouting matches. The sloppy direction by Estevez is rambling and unfocused, never really plumbing the depths of the love and jealousy that drove the brothers. It pales next to the passion ofBoogie Nightsand the complexities ofThe People vs. Larry Flynt, but for all its shortcomings it is a fascinating story, the underside of the outlaw American dream.The DVD also features commentary by Estevez and Sheen (who cracks so many deadpan jokes he keeps breaking up Emilio) and interviews with Marilyn Chambers and former San Francisco assistant district attorney Bernard Walter, who talk about the real-life Mitchell brothers.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00ET2ODTE", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00441GYZ6", "B00005MHOE", "B000LPS4L6", "B000PAAJZ6", "B000HT38HQ", "B004RQDWIU", "B0041SI7AM", "B00AKLLSNC", "B00EMAGKNU", "B002AT4JNI", "B000A1INIU", "B00GGY4R3K", "B003AWRMA6", "B00EU8RCO0", "B0060WH7JE", "B00GDDNFDW", "B003Y5H5EM", "B00CPTUNUG", "B00006L92O", "B009L79YRI", "B00BTYIHWO", "B0000AINPE", "6305504024", "B00HOGBXTU", "B000803BPS", "6304852436", "B000HT38EO", "B002ZG97RY", "B000BLBZG6", "B001AZKB8K", "B0000VV55I", "B000BR9S96", "B001C5LLVE", "B001AIQ14A", "B002AMVEII", "B005XB8T68", "B00008IHAW", "B00AEBB9DW", "B00013WWT8", "B000PMFS2I", "079284646X", "B00EK52XQK", "630542828X", "0671751565", "B005FUTC1I", "B000EMGF26", "B00008G85N"], "bought_together": ["B00ET2ODTE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AKLLSNC", "B000065V3E", "B000BLBZG6", "B000063JDM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 136561}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.64, "brand": "SHOWTIME ENTERTAINMENT", "asin": "B0000542C4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C27Q9GPSL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Rated X (Unrated Version)"}

{"description": "Prepare to enter the world of Coffin Joe! Unholy undertaker, evil philosopher, denizen of dreams and hallucination--Coffin Joe, with his trademark top hat, black cape and long talon-like finger nails, is a horror icon in his native Brazil. He is the creation of writer-director-star Jose Mojica Marins whose perversely original and strangely personal filmmaking style has been compared to an unholy blend of Mario Brava, Luis Bunuel and Russ Meyer. The film debut of Coffin Joe was also the first true horror film made in Brazil. Joe terrorizes a small religious community in his search for the perfect woman to bear a child. Frightening, atmospheric and startlingly graphic for it's time. 35 year later, \"At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul\" has become an international horror classic.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000A2ZSP", "B0000A2ZSQ", "B00005ABVK", "B004D67ZO6", "B000S0GYRU", "B00AWWX8YG", "B00FMDL4UK", "B00IQAUO6Q", "B00IQAUO48", "B00IQAUO2A", "B00BCMT2BI", "B000F3UA8E", "B00JJOY41E", "B000HXDWNM", "B00KDU8HQQ", "B0002V7SLQ", "B00005NKTH", "B00BCMSY80", "B005ZHBEPI", "B001AGNMFI", "B001D5C1R6", "B00E3H3CO2", "B00ARWX9NG", "B001B187L6", "B009IV2Z3M", "B00K0MM4AM", "B000TUDBGG", "B000069I0A", "B000TZJCMS", "B000GSYRY6", "B005FRWU5Q", "B000MV8AC2", "B00D7AM71A", "B000KRNG54", "B005Y1B3EW", "B0024FAG2G", "B0015TZKPA", "B000095J42", "B00CLIAACC", "B00009NHC0", "B000HXDWRS", "B001D5C1OO", "B000067J0M", "B00A429Y56", "B008CB8CJK", "B00A429Y9M", "B0053TWWAE", "B00AWWX6XY", "B001F2W58W", "B008BWFOZA", "B000YKI4T0", "B000BB1926", "B004X63SCY", "B00GGY4R3K", "B000IJ7A5Q", "B00005YJMX", "B008G1JIQC", "B000EHT5MI", "B000063K1F", "B0087MN9HO", "1598830392", "B000094J72", "B0002VER3S", "B005DZKE9E", "B0016PDZGO", "B007SAKXKC", "B00APNJ8IC", "B00GK6V1UG", "B0001DMX1A", "B000E6EK56", "B000H1RFGY", "B000HXDWO6", "B0002V7SSY", "B00005Y6ZA", "B0002V7SRU", "B004J0TW24", "B00008V6YB", "B00006LPCZ", "B001U3EOLC", "B0010X746Y", "B00005A069", "B000E41MTA", "B0002JP2SO", "B00005OCLF"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001U3EOM6", "B001U3EOLC", "B0000A2ZSQ", "B0000A2ZSP"]}, "price": 40.68, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 324305}, "asin": "B00005ABVJ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413Y7XK6HTL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul"}

{"description": "With its modest special effects, lean plot, and small cast of lesser  stars, this 1951 thriller remains a sturdy blueprint for fusing horror and  science fiction. The formula has been employed countless times since, fleshed  out with more extensive and elaborate production values, and manned by higher profiled marquee names, but the results have yet to improve onThe Thing from Another World, Howard Hawks's lone foray into sci-fi.The story begins as military airmen are dispatched to a remote Arctic research station where scientists have detected the crash of a spacecraft.  An effort to retrieve the saucer-shaped vehicle fails, but the team returns to the station with the frozen body of its sole occupant. When the extraterrestrial pilot is accidentally thawed, the crew, headed by a tough-talking pilot (Kenneth Tobey), grapples with a massive, chlorophyll-based humanoid (James Arness) thirsty for blood and in no mood for galactic diplomacy.Hawks takes only a production credit for this low-budget exercise, but his filmmaking style transcends Christian Nyby's nominal direction: rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose professionalism is tempered by wisecracks, and unsentimental female characters (embodied by feisty romantic interest Margaret Sheridan) recall Hawks's signature works, while propelling the plot over any potential gaps in credibility. It's hardly surprising, then, thatThe Thing from Another Worldremains among the most influential science fiction movies ever shot, or that it remains exciting entertainment a half century later.--Sam Sutherland", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JKFR", "0783240953", "6303257801", "6302120101", "B00007JME0", "B000AQKU72", "B000DZC5PA", "B007Y1NNAW", "6300183084", "B00005R1O7", "6302890721", "0790731975", "6304507348", "0792835077", "6301977742", "0783236352", "6301977149", "6301968948", "6300208508", "B0000068SI", "B000JTATHG", "6301661729", "6304429274", "6300247589", "0790752395", "6302526191", "B000HDNPM0", "6303398375", "630442972X", "6303953492", "6302763835", "6301976401", "0783103107", "6300215539", "6302843200", "630168740X", "6300213900", "6300216500", "6300181278", "6302841798", "6300213838", "6302182530", "6300269477", "6300185281", "6300247597", "6301562178", "0790736055", "6300182533", "6300181340", "B00004R67T", "630258793X", "6303082815"], "bought_together": ["B00005JKFR", "B007Y1NNAW"], "also_viewed": ["B0067QPVJ6", "6300182878", "B000FOPPEC", "6303506291", "B00005JKFR", "6300247171", "B0045HCJKS", "B00AEBB8VK", "B00IYJFB2G"]}, "price": 5.0, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 345640}, "asin": "B00005JG70", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5120YBRYW7L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Thing From Another World [VHS]"}

{"description": "Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) turns up the intensity level with TRAINING DAY, a charged drama about police corruption in downtown Los Angeles. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a well-intentioned young officer who thinks he's found his ticket to becoming a detective in the form of undercover officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris is a notorious figure in the streets and in the office. He also has the authority to make Jake's professional wishes come true, provided Jake is able to prove his worth on Alonzo's team. At first, Alonzo's blunt, carefree demeanor provides a shock to Jake's optimistic system, but as it becomes clear that Alonzo is dangerously out of control, Jake must decide whether or not to risk his future in the name of the law.\n\nWashington's performance as the evil, pragmatic detective is a sight to behold. He delivers his lines with a devilish ferocity that keeps the film bubbling throughout. Hawke slips into the role of the rookie everyman with ease, providing a good contrast to Washington's fiery presence. Former video director Fuqua completes the picture by casting musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray in supporting roles.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0792841778", "630268644X", "6303012140", "6300214826"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 428216}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.0, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AYTB1GNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Training Day [VHS]"}

{"description": "Director Frank Darabont created this Frank Capra-inspired drama based on a screenplay by his friend and one-time schoolmate Michael Sloane. Jim Carrey stars as Pete Appleton, a screenwriter in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Pete's on top of the world with his first motion picture \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara\" just released to theaters and his romance with a beautiful starlet (Amanda Detmer) heating up. However, his triumph turns to dismay when he's called before the commie-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and advised by a studio lawyer and his agent to play ball with the witch hunters. Depressed by the film industry's weak-kneed reaction to the hearings, Pete gets drunk and drives his car north along the California coast, where he crashes from a bridge and wakes up on shore the next morning suffering from amnesia. Wandering into the nearby small town of Lawson, Pete is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a lost hero of World War II who, like most of the area's young men, never returned from the war a decade earlier. \"Luke\" has soon reunited with both his father (Martin Landau) and his one-time girlfriend (Laurie Holden), and finds that his reappearance has given the citizens of Lawson an emotional boost that's sorely needed. When he refurbishes and reopens his family's decrepit movie theater, the Majestic, Luke revitalizes Lawson just as his memory of his true identity begins to reassert itself. Sloane's original script for The Majestic (2001) was entitled The Bijou.", "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 298103}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 1.75, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005JKNB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GZ710HSNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Majestic [VHS]"}
{"description": "The plethora of extras on this two-disc set are worth your time. There are several well-produced segments on the physical aspects of the film highlighted by a tour of the vast Cinecitt&#xE0; Studio sets with director Martin Scorsese and production designer Dante Ferretti (with a 360-degree-view feature to boot). Historian Luc Sante introduces you to the Five Corners area in New York circa the mid-19th century, and there's a vintage vocabulary guide (from the 1859 edition ofThe Rogue's Lexicon). Even though it was made as a \"puff piece\" for the movie, the Discovery Channel show \"Uncovering the Real Gangs of New York\" is an informative half-hour on the film's historical background. There's another espresso double-shot from a Scorsese commentary track. Not recorded traditionally as he watches the movie, the track pieces together thoughts from the director including some recorded in an NPR interview. This allows Scorsese to be even more focused, dealing with the history of the time and his own 30-year struggle to make the film. One serious demerit for stretching the feature film over both discs, which most likely had to be done with having both Dolby 5.1 and DTS tracks along with the commentary on the long film.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000M341QE", "B00AEBB9CS", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8NI", "B006OFN0SE", "B00005JLSB", "B000C20VPA", "B000MZHW40", "B001N44BVQ", "B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B00049QQHI", "B004SIP8ZM", "0767830555", "6305313687", "B0006GAOJA", "B00008975Z", "B0016Q2D66", "B0000DI87S", "B00008DP4C", "B00011CZRE", "B000P0J0EW", "B00004XPPB", "B008R65XYC", "B005LAIIJY", "B0007DFJ0G", "B000C20VRS", "B004SIP95G", "B000286RP2", "B002CPMB9O", "B002T9H2LA", "0307388980", "B004SIP7ZS", "B000A7DVR2", "B00AEFXKUI", "B008MILL8W", "B00AEBB9F0", "B001EZE5DI", "B00AEBB9NM", "B004FQX5B6", "B002QEHPQU", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00H9KKGTO", "B004SIP6GI", "B002VWNIEA", "B0001FGBUW", "B000A2UBN4", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00003CWM3", "B008D1Q1VA", "B00005V9HH", "B003ASLJQI", "B003ASLJQS", "B007SPPANM", "B000093FLA", "B00003CXZ4", "B00004XPPG", "B00001ZWUS", "B000H5TH20", "B000FKO5QK", "B002ZG99N6", "6304711905", "B0018CMJSU", "0767817710", "B009AMANBA", "079284646X", "B000FS9FCG", "B000065U1N", "B00AEBB89W", "B000P0J0AG", "B004SIP6QI", "B001QTXM5Y", "B004499LWG", "0783227906", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000J4P9P8", "B001GZ6QC4", "B00AEFY5B6", "B00AEBB95K", "B000NOKFHQ", "B002VWNICC", "B00009W5CA", "B004U7MR14", "B004AOECXI", "B00003CXRM", "0783231202", "B000069HZP", "0783229526", "B001JIE7JC", "B00005221M", "B000N6TX1I", "B00005JMJG", "B000N3SRO0", "B00003CXWV", "B00005JMYI", "B003HKN52U", "0790732238", "B00004U103", "B003UESJHO", "B000P0J09C"], "bought_together": ["B000M341QE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002ZG980U", "B000P0J09M", "B0013FXWU6", "B00H9KKGTO"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 46244}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 12.89, "brand": "Miramax", "asin": "B00005JKN9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W0haa4aL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"}

{"description": "Outstanding picture and sound plus tons of features makeCharlie's Angels: Full Throttlea fully loaded DVD.  Don't expect more T&A; in the unrated edition, however.  The only difference is glimpses of more intense violence in a few of the fight scenes.  For example, in the theatrical version you'll see an angel flying through the air, but in the unrated version you'll then see her lying expressionless on the ground.  Also, blood flies out of Drew Barrymore's mouth in one scene.  On his commentary track, director McG discusses inside jokes, visual effects, and shots that didn't quite work for him.  Like a TV sportscaster, he uses a telestrator, but only to occasionally circle items of interest or draw arrows.  There's also an amusing commentary track by the three writers, who chuckle over inside jokes and discuss how the film was changed from the original script.  They preface their comments with: \"I guess they asked us to do this just to prove that writers worked on this movie.\"  \"Who are we kidding?  Who's listening to this right now?\"If you want still more info, there's a trivia track with pop-up factoids with occasional links to more featurettes, a jukebox that offers clips of 11 songs and explanations of why they were picked, a cameo-graphy that offers clips of 13 personalities and why we should know them, and eight 4- to 18-minute featurettes exploring such topics as stunts, vehicles, costumes, and the Pussycat Dolls dance troupe.  And in the next evolution of product placement, the DVD-ROM \"Shop the Scene\" feature allows you to search for a character's outfit or gadget then buy it online.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00164EAGY", "B00003CXZ1", "B00AEFYGBA", "B000069HYG", "B0000SX9N2", "B00005JL8Z", "B00004ZDO9", "B008H6GHII", "B000UDGOC0", "B007AFC0RY", "B0006L0LOS", "B000085EFK", "B0007P0Y7C", "B00003CXMP", "B00024JC4E", "B00016MSV2", "B0007PLLBU", "B001C5LLQ4", "B00005MEVO", "B000BKJ758", "B000MX7V70", "B000035Z3G", "B002GHHHL0", "B000LC3ICE", "B000FDFSH2", "B0006GANPA", "B000Y11BC6", "B000AP04FG", "B00026ZG10", "B0041KKYGU", "B00005JMUA", "0767819640", "B0018PH3KQ", "B00008G7UI", "B00BLN4V0A", "B002GOAH1A", "B00006HAWN", "B0001BS3IE", "B0009RCPUW", "B002ZG984Q", "B001EDVNNU", "B000VI70QS", "B004LWZW2O", "B000A343RI", "B0006FO8E8", "B000EGDB10", "B000RW3VCU", "B00005JN4H", "B00BTYMPUY", "B00005J761", "B000CEXGAU", "B005TK0MFE", "B0041ONFOE", "B000VG66XS", "B00ID8H98C", "B00007AJF5", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B0009W5JR8", "B008JFURII", "B00001PE4D", "B000M7FOO8", "B004P7CN7W", "B0000DZ6N3", "B00005JM5B", "B00007GZRP", "B000ARXF96", "B0018CNNV2", "B000CCW2P2", "B0009KA2OA", "B002O3Z4ZW", "B00006G8JD", "B0008FXT1Y", "B0000524E5", "B002GSXKOW", "B00005JM55", "B003Q6D2B4", "B005CFBYW6", "B00008WJD6", "B000ENC5YW", "B003FCKI3O", "B005Z9MFRC", "B00004STVN", "B00005JG6N", "B00E1HIXEI", "B0007OCG56", "B00005JMEW", "B000BTIU4S", "B00008WJEZ", "B000NIBURQ", "B000EQ5V8G", "B0001Z37HM", "B003PIUINS", "B00005JMW7", "B00196UTEG", "B000A2IPQY", "B004SIP6VI", "B00005JLZW", "B00005JNTU", "B00AEFXCLU"], "bought_together": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B00AEFYGBA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002A5EBMQ", "B0000CABE5", "B000069HYG", "B008JFUUIA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26650}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.9, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00005JLYW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L5TYVcBmL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Disney changes how they have been delivering their recent theatrical hits and improves the DVD experience. Gone is the creators' commentary track; instead there's a robust 45-minute feature on the making of the film that opens up the audience to older kids interested in the craft. The commentary track is for laughs with the MacKenzie Brothers-influenced moose Rutt & Tuke (SCTValumnus Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) having a good old time; it's a treat for adults as kids. Also, the traditional still gallery has been replaced by a deft 10-minute display of the various artwork, narrated by the artists. All the deleted scenes are voiced and in various forms of animation; additionally there is a Phil Collins song that was not used in the film. Disney reaches into Pixar's bag of tricks with \"outtakes\" that kids will love, along with the two above-average set-top games. Connoisseurs should appreciate the options: both 2.35 and 1.77 widescreen formats are offered as well as 5.1 Dolby and DTS sound.--Doug Thomas", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000FQISFS", "B00029LO0Y", "B00005RDSQ", "B00005JLR2", "B000AAF1TU", "B001O5LVPI", "B001ILFUD2", "B00005TN8K", "B000DWMYQ8", "B0084IHVUC", "B000AAF1U4", "B0084IHVGG", "B003E66Y3E", "B0034GK74G", "B00003CXG7", "B00CTNYLQA", "B004ZBACOE", "B00AO686JC", "B000G75AZC", "B0000AOX0O", "B000L22SG6", "B00007LVCM", "B0084IHVN4", "B00004R99S", "B00GDT5T9Y", "B0007PIDBQ", "B000089G5O", "B000GW8U1I", "B000ROAK2W", "B000B8QG4A", "B000056H26", "B00BG0RSJ4", "B003H9M1Q2", "B003RACGZM", "B0002YLCOM", "B000YERP2S", "B00CUDD0C0", "B0000E32WJ", "B00CQRN3QI", "B0007KTBIU", "B000B8QG3G", "B0000VV4W2", "B000BITUVG", "B0001I561E", "B000HWZ4Q6", "B00024I2Z4", "B00009YXAW", "B00003CXB4", "B001FAFO3W", "B00EV1YZ96", "B0007Z9R0M", "B0006JMLRK", "B003E66Y84", "B000063V8M", "B0000524D0", "B001OMU6UM", "B00003CXCQ", "B001ILFUDC", "B000VBJEEG", "B00006LPHB", "B0034JKZ86", "B00005T7H3", "B003ZHVJGO", "B00004R99F", "B000050MN3", "B000096IAI", "B00000JGOQ", "B00G5G7EXY", "B00005T7H7", "B0013ND30M", "B00335EQ0E", "B0001I55VA", "B008YWY0HK", "6305161887", "B000H7JCK0", "B000F48D5U", "B00AFEX83C", "B004G600A4", "B00004R99Y", "B0012EM5D8", "B00004R99H", "B001FTIJS0", "B004A8ZX0K", "B0006UEVT0", "B004HO6I4M", "B000B8QFYG", "B00CHVJODE", "B007MDB6L0", "B00E9ZATJO", "B000035Z48", "B0024NSFYY", "B00005JNQS", "B0052OPJ1E", "B002ZG97YM", "B001NCDFTW", "B0001I55W4", "B0039N74CW", "B0000764FF", "B000LRJD64", "B00005JNS0"], "bought_together": ["B000FQISFS", "B000AAF1TU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00CTNYLQA", "B000OLGCI4", "B00CWM58WY", "B001O5LVPI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 6077}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.96, "brand": "Disney", "asin": "B00005JMFH", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61LoOHu0mzL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Brother Bear (Two-Disc Special Edition)"}

{"description": "WithInfernal Affairs, Hong Kong filmmakers Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak have successfully taken a smart script and a great cast, added some stylistic cinematography, and dual-fistedly given a new twist to a formulaic genre.  Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau), a young, loyal gangster, is ordered by his Triad boss Sam (Eric Tsang) to join the police force. While on the inside the young mole can keep a close eye on police activity, ensuring the gang's activities will not be interrupted. Police Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang) has a similar plan. He takes a bright, ambitious police cadet Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and makes him an undercover cop with plans to get him inside the Triads.  Years pass and both are now deep into their assigned roles. Undercover cop Yan, more or less living the life of a gangster, is now a member of Boss Sam's group, and \"Officer\" Lau has all the appearance of a good cop trying to bust up the Triads' drug ring. During a bust that could finally bring down Boss Sam, the moles inadvertently become aware of each other's existence, and each is left wondering who is on the inside. What follows is a unique and exciting twist on the classic cat and mouse chase in which each man is not fighting for his life, but for his anonymity. In addition to its plot twists, what liftsInfernal Affairsabove the standard cop story is its subtle exploration of the relative nature of good and evil. Part action, part psychological examination,Infernal Affairsis a sharp and fresh take on the classic crime story, and the inspiration for a 2006 Martin Scorsese remake (The Departed). Not to be missed.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KX0IMC", "B000KX0IMM", "B000N4SHNK", "B0004Z302Q", "B0036BDQBU", "B00B6OEE7O", "B004H2CXBQ", "6305972532", "B000R7HXZQ", "B0009S2T0M", "B005ZMBEXU", "B00HSJ2EMI", "B000065V38", "B00C6WHPO4", "B000HC2M3Y", "B005HG8VE4", "B000GFLKDU", "B00J5LXST0", "B004SIP88Y", "B0018PH3NS", "B0010X7432", "B008XEZXES", "B0007Q6VXC", "B000R7HY2I", "B00003CXUM", "B004SIP6GI", "B003EVAG4C", "B000M341QE", "B000UAE7M2", "B001MYIXAC", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B0030A6ICG", "B00ET2ODYY", "B002C6VMIY", "B00AN5LCV8", "B00008R9LX", "B001F0TM3A", "B005FQ1OOK", "B000WGZGOC", "B000KX0IMW", "B006C1S1DY", "B000BRBA8S", "B000NVT0RK", "B00005JKG1", "B003INBNXO", "B000I0RNWU", "B000GSYRY6", "B0013D8LCM", "B005F96UGO", "B001O7SWHG", "B0010X741O", "B000MM0LEG", "B0085A9J18", "B00DSQTMRA", "B0056OZI0W", "B00C3ALL9O", "B000MM0LF0", "B00004W457", "B008WAM36O", "B00H47IXJW", "B0036TGSJE", "B00CG0YLS4", "B004I1AGTC", "B006L4MWVE", "B00003CXR4", "B0019PL2W0", "B00AN5LCOA", "B00006ADES", "B0010SAGHS", "B0010X740K", "B0009XRZQK", "B00002RAPT", "B000EE3FUY", "B009VL2AZM", "B003G715IK", "B00G3HOJZ6", "B009VL2A5M", "B0087OULO6", "B005F96UHI", "B000006A17", "B008U1ANCG", "B002ZPIBRC", "B00ENTX7JU", "B001BEK8E2", "B0076XTIWU", "B008IG0B0C", "B000Q7ZKWK", "B0056OZI0M", "B00AWHDEIQ", "B00BTFK014", "B00005YUNV", "B000E0OE44", "B003DVB7F0", "B002P7UCJK", "B005ZMBEXA", "B005M9VSMI", "6305081034", "B0040QYRTA", "B00772HQTC", "B0058M0848"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000N4SHNK", "B0036BDQBU", "B0085A9J18", "B004H2CXBQ"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 112979}, "asin": "B00005JN7C", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YGGXV9AJL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Infernal Affairs (Wu jian dao)"}

{"description": "Based on the perennial nonfiction bestseller by H.G. Bissinger,Friday Night Lightslooks at high school football in the harsh light of reality, finding heart and hardness while stirring our emotions. Actor-director Peter Berg (Very Bad Things, The Rundown) is Bissinger's cousin; he knows the material well, and understands how an obsession with winning turns high school kids into somber, over-pressured gladiators--expendable soldiers in a community war against shame and obscurity. The fact-based story focuses on the 1988 football season of Odessa-Permian high school in West Texas, and as a fast-paced sports movie, Berg delivers the goods with a rousing, frenetically styled crowd-pleaser. But there's darkness in this tale of weary underdogs, including an abusive father (well-played by country music star Tim McGraw), threatening townsfolk, an injured star running back (Derek Luke), a tormented quarterback (Lucas Black), and the melancholy coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who takes his team to the finals. Berg's film could use less flashy cutting and more drama to support its gridiron intensity, butFriday Night Lightsoffers a refreshing alternative to the conventional sports movie, and makes a perfect triple-feature with the equally exciting documentariesGo Tigers!andThe Last Game.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005JPBO", "B00AEBB9UU", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM", "B002NZK5QO", "B000J3OTT6", "B000EXZFCQ", "B00004W221", "6305428492", "B000KHYN9C", "0306809907", "B00AEFXOKO", "B002VECM6S", "B0001US66Y", "B001LGXIA6", "B00E1HIXFW", "B0032UYFAQ", "B004BFTFBU", "B003L77GCE", "0792843592", "B001RXDM2C", "B00B83N2NU", "B0014DO5XU", "B000RF1QE2", "B002O3Z4XY", "B000068NNU", "B00AEFYJI0", "B009YQJ2Q4", "B000A0GP0Y", "B000649YAM", "B00008EY60", "B000MNOX94", "1935618563", "B000FVR1T2", "B000GAKDAG", "B00AEFXJY0", "B009NNM9OA", "B001FB55NK", "B000ARTN3I", "630529142X", "B00002SSKG", "B00AEBB9AA", "630514415X", "0201196778", "B0060ZJ7BC", "B00553K9IA", "B00000G3PA", "B00004Z4WR", "6305313687", "B003UESJHO", "B00AEFYKWU", "0800141741", "B00028HBES", "B0002S94CK", "B0000AC8LH", "B00004RE45", "B000TZJBPQ", "B00009OWJV", "B000274T94", "B00005JLRZ", "B001G5T6GW", "B00AEBBA36", "B00004Y2R1", "B000035Z59", "B0068FZ0GK", "B000Y7WGOW", "B004KPLVX6", "B004GJYROG", "B00004TJQJ", "B003UESJ9M", "B000M4RG42", "B00AEBB86A", "B005OZVXCU", "B006X08ET0", "B00005JM10", "B00005JLG1", "B002GIBVVQ", "B00003CXTG", "B002ZG99N6", "B001FB55L2", "B00AEBBA2M", "0800177258", "B00003CXNY", "6304765258", "B000VG66XS", "B002YMWQ2M", "B000WZEZGI", "B0002J4YVK", "B0007LLPXI", "B004GJYRF0", "B000F4RH84", "B000F6ZIIS", "B000068QPY", "B002Q4VBPQ", "B002T4GWWA", "B0034G4P94", "B000NO39FG", "B000ADWDE8", "B00003GPFT", "B0000633U2"], "bought_together": ["B000056VP4", "B00005JPBO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GXKBF6", "0306809907", "B000056VP4", "B005CA4SOM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7523}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JNEW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X7RX6KY3L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing aboutRay. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B; legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from \"chitlin circuit\" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life.--Jeff ShannonMore on Ray CharlesModern Sounds in Country and Western Music(CD)The Genius of Ray Charles(CD)Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You(CD)Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection(CD)Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man(book)More Albums by Ray Charles", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000E8QVWY", "B001P3SA94", "B00465I1CE", "B00005JKMQ", "6305428409", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00AEFXTKO", "B0002LE9HC", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AEFYG3S", "0790739313", "B000JJSL1W", "B000A50460", "B00005TQ44", "0783230524", "B0009R1TJ0", "0780627822", "B00AEFZ63M", "B000P0J092", "B002VWNICM", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000JLTRH2", "B000N6U0E2", "B0041QSZS8", "0783237367", "078324228X", "B00AEFY6TW", "B003HKN534", "B00BTYPWDQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00007AJG1", "B00007L4KF", "B00ANDDBBY", "B000BITV9W", "0783114907", "B00007AJG2", "1558908390", "B00005JLRZ", "B000FVQLQQ", "6305692572", "0767821637", "B002CA68NO", "B00AFEXRME", "B002CPMB9O", "B004SIP93S", "B000063JDI", "B00005NB8K", "B00125WAWS", "6305505780", "B000IFRT4W", "B001TUZGPO", "B009NNM9OA", "B000RB6XG2", "B000P0J0CY", "B0001FR3IQ", "B000FVQLRA", "B00066FAVW", "B002XMGGK6", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00DW5IL2E", "B00005JPK8", "0767811070", "B000I0QL7I", "B000069I0E", "B00080ZG10", "0306814315", "B000P0J0EM", "B00AEFXP8K", "B00049QQHI", "B00000JGHV", "B0007CEXYK", "B0001Q4BOE", "B0000YEE6M", "B000NIVJF4", "B008Y1YJN6", "B00066VTU8", "B001132GNY", "B0006QAIG4", "B0034G4OSG", "B000C20VRS", "0800141741", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000Y11B8K", "B00005LB86", "B000056VP4", "B00005JL72", "B000095J01", "B000Q7ZNZ4", "B002CAWNEM", "B003UESJHO", "B00066FAQW", "0783230389", "B0013FDM7E", "B00007ELEO", "B00AMEZDJW", "B000P0J0CE", "B003Y5H4ZC", "0767821955", "B00003GPFT", "B0021L8V2A"], "bought_together": ["B000E8QVWY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0002LE9HC", "B000E8QVWY", "B000BOH8X2", "B00AZMFJYA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17277}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.89, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JND5", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RQ8ETK19L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Ray (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Movies don't come any bigger than Peter Jackson'sKing Kong, a three-hour remake of the 1933 classic that marries breathtaking visual prowess with a surprising emotional depth. Expanding on the original story of the blonde beauty and the beast who falls for her, Jackson creates a movie spectacle that matches hisLord of the Ringsfilms and even at times evokes their fantasy world while celebrating the glory of '30s Hollywood. Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a vaudeville actress down on her luck in Depression-era New York until manic filmmaker Carl Denham (a game but miscast Jack Black) entices her with a lead role. Dazzled by the genius of screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), Ann boards the tramp steamer S.S.Venture, which she--and most of the wary crew--believes is headed for Singapore. Denham, however, is in search of the mythic Skull Island, hoping to capture its wonders on film and make a fortune. What he didn't count on were some scary natives who find that the comely Darrow looks like prime sacrifice material for a mysterious giant creature....There's no point in rehashing the entire plot, as every movie aficionado is more than familiar with the trajectory ofKing Kong; the challenge facing Jackson, his screenwriters, and the phenomenal visual-effects team was to breathe new life into an old, familiar story. To that degree, they achieve what could be best called a qualified success. Though they've assembled a crackerjack supporting cast, including Thomas Kretschmann as theVenture's hard-bitten captain and young Jamie Bell as a plucky crewman, the first third of the movie is rather labored, with too much minute detail given over to sumptuous re-creations of '30s New York and the unexciting initial leg of theVenture's sea voyage. However, once the film finds its way to Skull Island (which bears more than a passing resemblance toLOTR's Mordor),Kongturns into a dazzling movie triumph, by turns terrifying and awe-inspiring. The choreography and execution of the action set pieces--including one involving Kong and a trio of Tyrannosaurus Rexes, as well as another that could be charitably described as a bug-phobic's nightmare--is nothing short of landmark filmmaking, and a certain Mr. Spielberg should watch his back, asKongtrumps most anything that has come before it.Despite the visual challenges ofKing Kong, the movie's most difficult hurdle is the budding romance between Ann and her simian soulmate. Happily, this is where Jackson unqualifiedly triumphs, as this unorthodox love story is tenderly and humorously drawn, by turns sympathetic and wondrous. Watts, whose accessibility balances out her almost otherworldly loveliness, works wonders with mere glances, and Andy Serkis, who digitally embodies Kong here much as he did Gollum in theLOTRfilms, breathes vibrant life into the giant star of the film without ever overplaying any emotions. The final, tragic act of the film, set mostly atop the Empire State Building, is whereKongearns its place in movie history as a work that celebrates both the technical and emotional heights that film can reach.--Mark Englehart", "related": {"bought_together": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000EHQTZO", "B00AEFYEU8", "B0087ZG7HK", "0767817478"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 32487}, "categories": [["Movies & TV"]], "price": 8.94, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B00005JO20", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Y54TGdwL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "More than a few critics hailedSpider-Man 2as \"the best superhero movie ever,\" and there's no compelling reason to argue--thanks to a bigger budget, better special effects, and a dynamic, character-driven plot, it's a notch aboveSpider-Manin terms of emotional depth and rich comic-book sensibility.Ordinary PeopleOscar-winner Alvin Sargent received screenplay credit, and celebrated author and comic-book expert Michael Chabon worked on the story, but it's director Sam Raimi's affinity for the material that bringsSpidey 2to vivid life. When a fusion experiment goes terribly wrong, a brilliant physicist (Alfred Molina) is turned into Spidey's newest nemesis, the deranged, mechanically tentacled \"Doctor Octopus,\" obsessed with completing his experiment and killing Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in the process. Even more compelling is Peter Parker's urgent dilemma: continue his burdensome, lonely life of crime-fighting as Spider-Man, or pursue love and happiness with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)? Molina's outstanding as a tragic villain controlled by his own invention, and the action sequences are nothing less than breathtaking, but the real success ofSpider-Man 2is its sense of priorities. With all of Hollywood's biggest and best toys at his disposal, Raimi and his writers stay true to the Marvel mythology, honoringSpider-Mancreators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and setting the bar impressively high for the challenge ofSpider-Man 3.--Jeff ShannonDVD Features:The first commentary track is by director Sam Raimi and a self-deprecating Tobey Maguire speaking in tandem, and producer (and Marvel CEO) Avi Arad and coproducer Grant Curtis speaking in tandem. They discuss a number of topics, including Raimi's memory of his excitement over Richard Donner's Superman and how the character of Black Cat had to be dropped from the film. The second commentary is by six members of the Oscar-nominated effects team, and one of their primary focuses is how Doc Ock's arms were achieved by a combination of puppetry and CGI.The centerpiece of the second disc is a massive two-hour documentary that can be viewed all at once or in 12 separate pieces. It covers the development of the story, the visual effects, costumes, stunts, and sound and music. Three shorter featurettes cover Peter Parker's struggle between his personal and hero lives, Doc Ock, and the women in Spider-Man's life, and what's interesting is how they discuss those topics not just in relation to the movies but to the comic books as well. (For example, Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy had a much greater impact in the comics.) There's a scene in which you can toggle among three different camera angles, and a gallery of 17 paintings Alex Ross created for the opening sequence. The sound and picture are spectacular, though only theSuperbit editionhas DTS.--David HoriuchiMore Spiderman on DVDTheSpidermanToy StoreThe First FilmSpider Manon the small screenThe SoundtrackGame Boy AdvanceThe BookMore Superheroes on DVDBatmanBladeThe HulkJimmy NeutronJustice LeagueKim PossibleRobocopSpider-ManSupermanWonder WomanX-MenAlso see our Action & Adventure StoreStills fromSpider-Man 2(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH", "B004LWZWFQ", "B001DHXT20", "B00E5I2MCM", "B00005JNTU", "B000VI70QS", "B001CDR1FG", "B001GCUO1Q", "B000AYELVA", "B00E5I2M6I", "B000AYELVU", "B008JFUO72", "B0083SBMBM", "B004LWZW42", "B004EPZ07K", "B00005JNJV", "B0002IQMAM", "B00E5I2MEK", "B000OVLBF8", "B00E5I2M9K", "B000HEVZ9E", "B008QZ5PY2", "B000HCO83Q", "B00JPS7HOA", "B001QB9H1U", "B00IGVJGYQ", "B0000959N0", "B0007P0Y7C", "B002GSXKN8", "B008JFUPFI", "B000J10EQU", "B0007V6ITE", "B0090SI56Y", "B001GZ6QC4", "6307397594", "B008JFUS0U", "B000IJ79VQ", "B000VR0570", "B002ZG99B8", "B00005JKWJ", "B004LWZWGA", "B005G4TJUC", "B002IPFWTE", "B00005JM5E", "B005LAIGW8", "0767817478", "B000H30B2C", "B002A5EBLW", "B0006L0LOS", "B000U7WV1Y", "B0000VCZLG", "B000P0J06K", "B002GSXKNI", "B002HWRYJE", "B0004Z33EQ", "B0009A409S", "B001DJLD2G", "B000I0RQVI", "B00HWWUQWQ", "B0007RT9MG", "B001GKJ2E8", "B0000AXE8I", "B007K3JFUQ", "B00004STUL", "B00BEZTMFY", "B000P0J06U", "B000957O82", "1402778007", "B0039N74CW", "B003UESJF6", "B00F4FFO8E", "B001HN697M", "B001OST0LW", "B0060FXDCG", "B0049IHX2C", "B000P0J0A6", "B000CEVC9M", "B000UVKGPI", "B009JBWOU0", "B00005JM5B", "B00I6JOD2S", "B001EDVNNU", "B000O77SRC", "B0000633UA", "B000P6XQ50", "B000E8M0VA", "B00008G8M4", "B000EGDB10", "B007REV4T8", "B00BPA2PEI", "B008Y1YK9Y", "B005OY6LBE", "0780624890", "B002935GMS", "0767803434", "6305428042", "B000O78KW4", "B009HIKAN8"], "bought_together": ["B000UR9T8C", "B00005JKCH"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004LWZWFQ", "B003YAR97K", "B00005JKCH", "B000UR9T8C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9593}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.0, "brand": "Marvel Kids", "asin": "B00005JMQW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Critics and controversy aside,The Da Vinci Codeis a verifiable blockbuster. Combine the film's huge worldwide box-office take with over 100 million copies of Dan Brown's book sold, andThe Da Vinci Codehas clearly made the leap from pop-culture hit to a certifiable franchise. The leap for any story making the move from book to big screen, however, is always more perilous. In the case ofThe Da Vinci Code, the plot is concocted of such a preposterous formula of elements that you wouldn&#x92;t envy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the man tasked with making this story filmable. The script followsDan Brown&#x92;s bookas closely as possible while incorporating a few needed changes, including a better ending. And if you&#x92;re like most of the world, by now you&#x92;ve read the book and know how it goes: while lecturing in Paris, noted Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to the Louvre by French police to help decipher a bizarre series of clues left at the scene of the murder of the chief curator. Enter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), gifted cryptologist. Neveu and Langdon team up to solve the mystery, and from there the story is propelled across Europe, ballooning into a modern-day mini-quest for the Holy Grail, where secret societies are discovered, codes are broken, and murderous albino monks are thwarted&#x85; oh, and alternative theories about the life of Christ and the beginnings of Christianity are presented too, of course. It&#x92;s not the typical formula for a stock Hollywood thriller. In fact, taken solely as a mystery, the movie almost works--despite some gaping holes--mostly just because it keeps moving. Brown&#x92;s greatest trick was  to have the entire story take place in one day, so the action is forced to keep moving, despite some necessary pauses for exposition. As a screen couple, Hanks and Tautou are just fine together but not exactly memorable; meanwhile Sir Ian McKellen&#x92;s scenery-chewing as pivotal character Sir Leigh Teabing is just what the film needed to keep it from taking itself too seriously. The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip.--Daniel VanciniVisit The Da Vinci Code StoreOn The DVDThe DVD extras on a film as popular asThe Da Vinci Codeshould be plentiful, and this version doesn&#x92;t skimp. With over 90 minutes of special features, including ten behind-the-scenes featurettes, there&#x92;s a lot here to explore beyond the film itself. The question is, is there anything new here that we haven&#x92;t heard before, in all the hype, pseudo-documentaries, and controversy surrounding the movie, to make it worthwhile?  For most viewers, the answer will be \"yes.\" Essentially, if you like the movie, if you enjoyed the book, you will get a lot out of them.Just as the movie is intended to make the book come to life, the DVD extras should make the film come to life by pointing the audience into the world of the filmmakers, connecting the dots between print and film, and for the most part they do just that. The extras here range from the typical look behind-the-scenes to more in-depth features on the supporting characters, the locations, and theMona Lisaherself.  \"First Day on the Set with Ron Howard\" features the director gushing about the opportunity to film in the Louvre and work with Tom Hanks again (the two worked together before onSplashandApollo 13). It&#x92;s a short piece that doesn&#x92;t reveal much beyond making an attempt to share Howard&#x92;s excitement (with the \"Gee, I really loved working with him/her on this project\" that you hear in every such featurette), but viewers might enjoy seeing how the stage was set up in the famous museum, down to the spike tape on the floor showing actors where to hit their marks.The Filmmaking Experience, Parts 1 and 2further explores the creative and technical aspects of the filmmaking process.A Conversation with Dan Brownstarts out feeling like a puff-piece (the man who wrote this book got started at age 5 with a story calledThe Giraffe, The Pig, and the Pants on Fire. \"It was a thriller,\" he says.) and unfortunately it doesn&#x92;t go very deep into much of anything of interest. But on the other hand, this isn&#x92;t60 Minuteshere; it&#x92;s intended to give viewers a better sense of the man behind the franchise, which it does.  Much of the footage from this interview is sprinkled throughout some of the other featurettes. Meanwhile, the character behind the franchise, Robert Langdon, is examined in his own featurette, as is Sophie Neveu. The cool thing here is getting under the skin of the actors to see how they approached the characters, knowing that most of the movie-going public already has formed their own ideas about the characters from the book.The most interesting extras are the featurettes that focus on the history behind the mystery. Or is it the mystery behind the history?  Either way, the first one on theMona Lisa, and the second featurette on the many codes and symbols that are hidden throughout the movie balance out the remainder of the extras nicely by demonstrating the sense of intrigue, mystery, and game-playing adventure that madeThe Da Vinci Codeso popular in the first place.--Daniel VanciniBeyondThe Da Vinci CodeThe Films of Tom HanksThe Films of Ron HowardThe Da Vinci DVDs: Decoding \"The Da Vinci Code\"More About The ArtistStills fromThe Da Vinci Code(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E", "B0013BM63O", "B002ZTQVKM", "B0007XG02W", "B001OLP2TI", "B002C68WNW", "0307474275", "B002O5M4SU", "B00005JLSB", "B000PHVZNE", "B0077ATSSQ", "B00AEFY0F2", "B000EPR7NE", "0743486226", "B001LMAK9W", "B000P0J0EW", "0385504209", "B005HWAOP2", "B001OQCV2E", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001EZE5D8", "B00005JL3T", "B000EOTW0Q", "6304711891", "B000YDBPAM", "0307950689", "B000HT386M", "B00008G8M4", "B000P0J0EM", "B002ZG99KO", "0800141806", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B00001ZWUS", "B0002V7OI8", "B002O3Z50Q", "B0006GANOQ", "B002NZK5UU", "B000NQRR1Q", "0385504225", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00005Y71F", "B000OYC7BW", "B00DL48BM6", "B00026ZG10", "B0018CWW5K", "B00004BZIY", "B0000B1OFL", "B00023B1LC", "B000N6U0E2", "B00A8MGIZG", "B00005JM5E", "B002LMV7R0", "B00004Z4WR", "B000K2UGXO", "B00005JMYC", "B001MVYUQG", "B00005JLWN", "B000056PMU", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEFY4CG", "B00441GYXS", "B001F12J0C", "B00ES28X3C", "B002ZG980U", "B001VLBDD0", "B00008K76U", "B001TK80C0", "B008JFURII", "B000VWYJ86", "0792159659", "B00AEFYGBA", "B0009MDPYM", "B00177YA1K", "B00005N5S5", "B0043X1FM2", "B0002J58HO", "B00005JM5B", "B00AZMFJYA", "B003AWRMBA", "074349346X", "B003VA3JUO", "0783240295", "6305767866", "B0000844I8", "B000065U1N", "B002GHHHKQ", "B000K7VHQE", "B0000AXE8I", "0800177258", "B000ASDFGI", "B003Q6D2B4", "B000HRMAPE", "B000U7WV1Y", "B00005JMOW", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0312944926", "B000VI70QS", "B000KF0GWW"], "bought_together": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00005JN5E"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002O5M4T4", "B00I563DSC", "B0013BM63O", "1400079152"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7555}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 7.5, "brand": "DaVinci", "asin": "B00005JOC9", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SLBDLMtIL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Literary adaptations just don't get any better than director Joe Wright's 2005 version of Jane Austen'sPride & Prejudice. The key word here isadaptation, because Wright and gifted screenwriter Deborah Moggach have taken liberties with Austen's classic novel that purists may find objectionable, but in this exquisite film their artistic decisions are entirely justified and exceptionally well executed. It's a more rural England that we see here, circa 1790 (as opposed to Austen's early 19th century), in which Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) is one of several sisters primed for marriage, with an anxious mother (Brenda Blethyn) only too desperate to see her daughters paired off with the finest, richest husbands available. Elizabeth is strong-willed and opinionated, but her head (not to mention her pride and prejudice) lead her heart astray when she meets the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), whose own sense of decency and discretion (not to mentionhispride and prejudice) prevent him from expressing his mutual affection. They're clearly meant for each other, and as Knightley's performance lights up the screen (still young enough to be girlishly impertinent, yet wise beyond her 20 years), Austen's timeless romance yields yet another timeless adaptation, easily on par with the belovedBBC miniseriesthat has been embraced by millions since originally broadcast in 1995. Individual tastes will vary as to which version should be considered \"definitive,\" but with a stellar supporting cast including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, this impeccable production achieves its own kind of perfection.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_viewed": ["0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B00G6HO368", "B004SIP7AS", "B004P7CNZO", "B0053Q9DHW", "B000244FDW", "B000GRUQKQ", "B000244FFU", "B0018YCF50", "B001L57ZZG", "B004XVMCMQ", "B00AF82WTO", "B008D1RCHC", "B000Z27HLS", "B000BEZQ0Y", "0767851013", "0486284735", "B0002ZH5PQ", "B0012Q3T6I", "6303921248", "B002XTBE6K", "B001PJRAUS", "B00HYMBAQ0", "B0080QOL1A", "B00062IZ0Y", "B001C4AFOY", "B0012XIGVE", "B002KHNFFS", "B000244FF0", "B0012OVCE6", "B00HYMASS6", "B0009UZGAA", "B000784WMW", "0767020308", "B000LPQ6DE", "B001TJYFRU", "B000FTCEYQ", "B000ZS8GW6", "B005GRF2UK", "B004FM2EL2", "B00G7QPXAI", "149440477X", "B009ERK0SW", "B00006ZXSK", "B0000AUHPK", "B004UOHNCA", "0767020294", "B00094AS9U", "B000Z27HMW", "B002DY9KR0", "B000N4SHOE", "B000683VI4", "193799418X"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00G6HO368", "0800141660", "B00003JRCQ", "B005S9EK5Y"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "asin": "B00005JOHI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZGC68T2JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Pride &amp; Prejudice"}

Joseph McCarthy in 1953-54, and emerged as a triumphant truth-seeker against the abuses of corporate and governmental power.David Strathairn as Edward R.

{"description": "Hedonistic bachelor Charlie (Charlie Sheen) is a jingles writer who, he blithely states, makes a lot of money for doing very little work, sleeps with beautiful women who don't ask about his feelings, drives a Jag and lives at the beach, and sometimes, in the middle of the day, for no reason at all, likes to make himself a big pitcher of margaritas and take a nap out on the sundeck.  His brother, Alan (Jon Cryer), evicted from his house by his soon-to-be-ex-wife, is \"rigid, inflexible, uptight, obsessive and anal-retentive.\" Charlie and Alan are \"twisted Jungian archetypes,\" according to series co-creator Chuck Lorre in one of this set's bonus features. If by \"twisted Jungian archetypes,\" he means Oscar and Felix fromThe Odd Couple, then yes, Charlie and Alan are \"twisted Jungian archetypes,\" and this inaugural season finds rich comic tension in their period of adjustment. Charlie is a Man Behaving Badly, whose idyllic life is upended when \"fuddy-duddy\" Alan moves in, accompanied by his impressionable 10-year-old son, Jake (Angus T. Jones), with whom he shares custody with his iceberg-cold, sexually confused (a comic conceit thankfully abandoned by season's end)  estranged wife, Judith (Marin Hinkle). Alan is a single father who is appalled by his amoral brother's lifestyle and by the influence Charlie might have on Jake (\"Uncle Charlie, I understand the point spread, but I'm still confused about the vig\"). And then there's Berta (effortless scene-stealer Conchata Ferrell), Charlie's formidable, tart-tongued housekeeper who is initially driven out the door by Alan's fussiness (\"The peanut butter stains on Jake's shirts really require an enzyme presoak\").Two and a Half Menis a guy show that sets feminism back a good three decades. Women are portrayed as either bimbonic objects of lust (Transformers' Megan Fox guest stars as Berta's teenage granddaughter), vengeful and retaliative (Heather Locklear as Alan's divorce lawyer), crazy hot (Jenna Elfman as an unstable single mother on the run), or emasculating (Holland Taylor as Charlie and Alan's mother, or, as Charlie refers to her, \"Mom, the Impaler\").  The charming Melanie Lynskey's is a particularly thankless role, that of Rose, Charlie's \"insightful and disturbing\" stalker, who becomes Jake's babysitter. While Charlie's \"bad-boy act\" could quickly get old in lesser hands, Sheen, in the past not the most natural of comic actors, is in his element. Charlie's genuine affection for Jake goes a long way toward redeeming his character (and lack of it).Two and a Half Men, a People's Choice Award-winner its first season, really adds up with a crudely funny sense of humor that is all kinds of wrong, but also smart and, at times, even sweet. --Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000WMA72C", "B0013D8M3U", "B0019D151K", "B001JAHSKU", "B001L1S1WQ", "B002N5N4PS", "B003L77G7E", "B005FISCFW", "B009LDD26Q", "B009TE9784", "B000W91RUG", "B00GO78384", "B0001ZMWXW", "B0001BS3IY", "B0058JEHTS", "B0000CGNEC", "B00E99FYEK", "B000HT3P7E", "B000RXZL0O", "B001FB4VXU", "B00K8HAKSW", "B000TZ7FTK", "B002N5N4M6", "B000G6BL88", "B000291Q3Y", "B009LDD1X0", "B000083C6V", "B0007R4SWC", "B001TKJDNA", "B00070HK4C", "B0053O8AQE", "B0006J27WY", "B00005JLEX", "B005D0OHA6", "B000M341S2", "B000JBWWQK", "B003L77G6A", "B00008YGRV", "B0000TPA60", "B000TM1CKQ", "B0002W4SX6", "B0002PYTD2", "B0058JEHSO", "B00BUWD7Y8", "B002OOWL3E", "B00009Y3RW", "B0000C9JFQ", "B000QFCDAO", "B0053O89WY", "B001UHN88I", "B009LDCVAE", "B000NNK4DW", "B001D2WUDE", "B00CKJJ1IG", "B007ZC31LQ", "B0019CLMW8", "B0001907BW", "B001RIZ7OI", "B000FKO3HQ", "B001DZOCVO", "B0038M2AQE", "B000A7PKGW", "B006MFQ4DE", "B007C8RZJW", "B000957O8C", "B001EAWLCK", "B007C8RZL0", "B0017W22LK", "B0002W4SWW", "B004H0M354", "B000RO6JZY", "B0002I837M", "B0072BNKIO", "B00BXTH474", "B0012018OE", "B0009YCLBS", "B003L77G7Y", "B0007US79Y", "B009LDD3I8", "B0019CSXAM", "B002JVWRDG", "B00000F5W8", "B00BM2JVAA", "B004EPYZP8", "B000NTMA1U", "B008LCRAC0", "B008L0YMZA", "B0024FAR6Q", "B004FM2EQC", "B00E99FY9K", "B001IARWR0", "B002E58FU6", "B0053O89Z6", "B00HW3EJ6Y", "B008LCRA7K"], "bought_together": ["B000WMA72C", "B0013D8M3U"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003L77G7E", "B0019D151K", "B005KR6NKY", "B001L1S1WQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 18234}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.99, "brand": "WHV", "asin": "B00005JOHC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xBfsFKH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Two and a Half Men: Season 1"}

{"description": "The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored inHard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee:  a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn,Hard Candybecomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and \"controversial\" ideas. Those actors are strong:  Patrick Wilson (Angels in America,Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations ofHard Candysometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0017VG5XM", "B00177YA6U", "B002VPTJOA", "B000ARFPMQ", "B004U7MR3W", "B0037E8HOC", "B00DVD5STQ", "B000YABYLA", "B00187FPC2", "B001MEJY8W", "B000WC38EQ", "B0013D8L7M", "B002EOVXBK", "B000FVQM2Y", "B000UCD4L0", "B00009MEC4", "B0051PLQR0", "6305313687", "B001G9CNI6", "B005Z9MGRG", "B003U6SJY0", "B008NNY8XQ", "B00125WATQ", "B0014VPFVS", "B00006AUIG", "B00DMUFXOS", "B001J4E19C", "B002VPTJNQ", "B00000I1KK", "B003L20IEC", "B004OUZLGK", "B000N3SU92", "B00699G622", "B00005Q4CS", "B0057ZAA6W", "B00005JMJG", "B008G1JIQC", "B0021L8UPS", "B00441GYVK", "B0007PID84", "B000NO39FG", "B00B96TGQS", "B001B187L6", "B000OYCMLM", "B005SQRYB4", "B0000AOX0A", "B000A2X3U2", "B00G5GNYY2", "B008G33PIM", "B0020LH8WU", "6305428484", "B000MMMTBY", "B002LMSWN2", "B007CZ3E7C", "B002USF1WC", "B004SIP9Z6", "B00005U14H", "0767802519", "B00AEFY2AA", "B0001GF2D8", "B001D2WU9I", "B00009W0U4", "B0000694XX", "B004LWZW24", "B0083QN87K", "B004Z1HY2W", "B000HC2LFI", "B0002J4X1Q", "B0000CABGW", "B007L6VRBM", "B0001EFUFK", "B003626TNG", "B009XTF8KQ", "B00ELQHX5O", "B007UW9W8W", "B001JNNDJM", "157362408X", "B0058ZPNOK", "B000EOTVU2", "B0082CWTSY", "B00AZTUUQK", "B001C5LLVE", "B000PKG8TM", "B00003CWQR", "B00007976U", "B001CDFY64", "B004XVMCH6", "B00003CWN3", "B0028DRGDQ", "B000FS2W3A", "B001U0HBQA", "B000N3AW6G", "B00005QAOZ", "B00BSU0FQA", "B00003CXKM", "B0002MPQRS", "B00BEIYGT8", "B0004Z31OS", "B001AZKB8K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002VPTJOA", "B00177YA6U", "B001MEJY8W", "B0017VG5XM"]}, "price": 2.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 421858}, "asin": "B00005JP3W", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FEBBE1B9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Hard Candy"}
{"description": "Leonardo DiCaprio puts a handsome face on an ugly industry: In parts of Africa, diamond mining fuels civil warfare, killing thousands of innocents and drafting preteen children as vicious soldiers. DiCaprio (The Departed) plays Danny Archer, a white African soldier-turned-diamond-smuggler who gets wind of a large raw jewel found by Solomon Vandy, a native fisherman (Djimon Hounsou,In America) recently escaped from enslavement by a brutal rebel leader. Archer offers a deal: He'll help Vandy find his war-scattered family if Vandy will share the diamond with him. Drawn into this web of exploitation is journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly,Little Children), who agrees to help if Archer will tell her the details of how conflict diamonds make their way into the hands of the corporations who sell them to the Western world. DiCaprio is compelling because he never flinches from Archer's utter ruthlessness; Archer ends up doing the morally justifiable thing, but only because his desperate greed has led him to it. Hounsou and Connelly, though saddled with all the moral and political speeches, rise above the cant and keep the movie's treacherously formulaic plot rooted in human characters.

Nobody could have imagined the impact that the striking Vianne (Binoche) would make when she arrived in a tranquil, old-fashioned French town. In her very unusual chocolate shop, Vianne begins to create mouth-watering confections that almost magically inspire the straitlaced villagers to abandon themselves to temptation and happiness! But it is not until another stranger, the handsome Roux (Johnny Depp -- SLEEPY HOLLOW), arrives in town that Vianne is finally able to recognize her own desires!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004SEUIXS", "B004XVMCMG", "B0000VD02Y", "0780621611", "B000LXHK2C", "0140282033", "B000053VAZ", "B004SIP9U6", "B002RSDW80", "B0034PHWG8", "B00008G7UF", "B004SIP7PS", "B00006ZXSI", "B0042816YK", "B004SIP7F8", "B00005TNEQ", "B004SIP7D0", "B000F7CECK", "B00AEBB9F0", "B000CBG5PG", "0783240171", "B000ETRCN0", "B002ZG988M", "B00005R87R", "B000EHRVOW", "B003B3V0W0", "B00166UFTS", "B004SIP6C2", "B00AEBB8YW", "B00005JKG1", "B001LPWGBY", "B004SEUJK0", "B000UVV26A", "B0000AOV4I", "B00005JPSM", "630560097X", "B00L16P1I8", "B0011FLH14", "B005S9EJ14", "B00CEIOGZG", "B005CFBZX4", "B000YDBPAM", "B00EIBO8T6", "B001HN69AY", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8JI", "B005MYEQ4U", "B0073U2EWM", "B00AEBBA72", "B0000CE684", "B00KQTGWPC", "B005ETAM4Q", "0147509785", "B0062VL4QA", "6305133468", "B001HN694K", "B00AZMFO6I", "B00006ZXSK", "B000LPR4U8", "B00006FMUW", "B000C8STWQ", "B000CCBCAS", "B007UW9W5U", "B001NLJ3NU", "B000BB1MI2", "B0045HCJJY", "B00DW5ILUG", "B00AEBB8OC", "B006ISJQ1W", "B0002234LS", "6305212112", "B000HT3PPG", "B001ECDVK4", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0001I55M4", "B000EDWKXI", "B00001W9G0", "B00004X13T", "B004SIP8W0", "B00000K3TN", "B0064MT1FI", "6305213283", "6304765266", "0800141741", "B000BNX3B4", "076782170X", "B00AEFY4CG", "B000056PMU", "B000F3UAFC", "B00003CXPD", "B000023VTP", "B0038N9WKU", "6304907729", "6305291403", "B00003A9QI", "B004GJYRA0", "B000077VR3", "B004SIP7ZS", "B00008G8LG", "B000RF7XYO"], "bought_together": ["B004SEUIXS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004SEUIXS", "B00C888MJ8", "B0000VD02Y", "0140282033"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 66054}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.98, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B00005K3OT", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BVvKaN4EL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)"}
{"description": "Dracula's DaughterThis cut-rate sequel toDracula, sans Bela Lugosi, turns out to be an unexpectedly sleek and stylish movie. Gloria Holden, tall, dark, and continental, is the aristocratic title character fighting her nature and seeking a cure for her affliction. A sympathetic psychiatrist, Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger), encourages her to \"face her fears,\" but when she lures a pretty young streetwalker to her room to model for a painting, the temptation of her fleshy offering proves too much to overcome. Edward Van Sloan reprises his role as Van Helsing, held by the police for the murder of Count Dracula (the film opens on the final scene fromDracula) but released in the nick of time to help Garth, now at the mercy of the bitter and vindictive vampire. Director Lambert Hillyer makes the most of his low budget, with austere, angular sets and an almost abstract sense of the foggy city night. Holden's mysterious face and tall, willowy body make her an even more striking vampire than Lugosi, and Irving Pichel's offbeat servant is like an American gangster with the breeding of a European aristocrat: thick and thuggish, but always proper. The script falls into the usual rut of Universal's later horror films, losing the mood in the busy plot, but the smooth style and Holden's dignified performance liftDracula's Daughterabove most Universal sequels.Son of DraculaIt was perhaps inevitable that, after playing the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and the Mummy, Lon Chaney Jr. would round out his horror resum&eacute; with a turn at the great bloodsucker himself (not, as the title would suggest, his son). Looking dapper and dignified under the cape, if not exactly threatening, Chaney plays Count Alucard (that'sDraculaspelled backwards), a mysterious Carpathian summoned to America by a \"morbid\" heiress (Louise Allbritton). Eric Taylor's script is rather clunky, but the story (by horror specialist CurtThe WolfmanSiodmak) is often quite clever, playing like a supernatural twist on a psycho-thriller. Allbritton's frustrated fianc&eacute; Robert Page accidentally \"kills\" her while trying to shoot Alucard (who imperiously stands up to the hail of bullets) and then goes stark raving mad as he watches the dead rise to life and the living disappear in wisps of smoke and morph into creaky stage bats.Future film noir legend (and Curt's brother) Robert Siodmak (The Killers) does wonders with the swampy, misty Deep South setting despite his obviously threadbare budget, transforming the usual clich&eacute;s into moments of inspired melodrama. Only the clumsy antics of the skeptical cops and the plodding exposition spouted by an old Carpathian doctor (he just happens to be the local MD) get in the way of this moody minor horror gem.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4N", "B00005LC4M", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4O", "B0000694WM", "B000035Z3K", "B0009X770E", "B00000F62P", "B000WNHTCC", "B00005NSXY", "B0009X770O", "B0016586Q8", "B006TTC5J0", "B00B94VJYW", "B001B9ZVVC", "078323502X", "B003M8NGG2", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00001TZ6Q", "B000U1ZV7G", "0783240961", "B000GRUQJW", "B00000JQB7", "B000FWHW90", "B000UDGOBG", "B00000ILEU", "B00005KHJP", "B00009PY38", "0783233582", "B0000694WH", "B00D9EJFZA", "B00LMCDHMS", "B00LNBQ8UG", "B0034PWPHY", "B0000AUHOO", "B0007R4T26", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000FVQLKW", "B00D9EJFV4", "B0002NRRQU", "B000RXVNCY", "B005D0RDKM", "B00009PY4D", "B008HSK3PE", "B00005R1O7", "B00HFWETZ8", "B000EHSVJG", "B00009NHBC", "B000068TPF", "B000K7VL56", "B00000JMOF", "B000063UR0", "B0002KVULG", "B0000AUHOK", "B002945DUW", "B000UAFDR0", "B000060MVD", "B00009PY4A", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00005AUK0", "B001BSBBGC", "B002DY9KQG", "B000A0GOFA", "B00005RF2C", "B00006G8K0", "B0001CNRLG", "B00009NHC0", "B00FJYXP36", "B009AGEY98", "B0013XZ6SY", "B007Y1NNAW", "B00005NKTH", "B00FMGPWNW", "B007ZFSBWW", "B00DZP1C9K", "B0007R4SZY", "B000RXVND8", "0783240953", "B000VX9WB4", "B000AQKU72", "B000TUDBGG", "B000TLTCT0", "B000R7I48G", "B00ITZXDDY", "B00AWWX8YG", "B00009PY48", "B001BSBBIA", "B00FUABJJQ", "B000A0GOFK", "B000062XEY", "B00005KHJO", "B00000K3U3", "B000AM6OOY", "1559409002", "078324097X", "B00456VHMA", "B007UQ8IQU", "B000BYA5IC", "6305944288"], "bought_together": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00005LC4L", "B00005LC4K", "B00005LC4N", "B006TTC5J0"]}, "price": 12.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 40262}, "asin": "B00005LC4J", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518j6eYh1hL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Dracula's Daughter/Son of Dracula (Universal Studios Dracula Double Feature)"}

And though they didn't write or direct this movie, it certainly has the same elements: charming lead actors (in this case, Heather Graham fromAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Meand Chris Klein fromElectionandAmerican Pie) put through all sorts of comic grotesqueries, ranging from having an ear cut off to getting a hand stuck up a cow's rectum. Orphaned dogcatcher Gilly (Klein) and incompetent hairdresser Jo (Graham) fall in love, only to discover that Gilly's long-lost mother is Jo's own white trash momma (played with gusto by Sally Field). Unfortunately, they'd already slept together, so Jo flees in shame to go back to her ex-boyfriend in Beaver, Oregon. But when Jo's real brother shows up, Gilly sets out to win Jo back--only her mom wants her to marry the ex and tells the Beaver police that Gilly is a sexual predator.Say It Isn't Sodoesn't have the crude wit ofThere's Something About Mary, but there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and both Graham and Klein are sweet and engaging.

{"description": "Deservedly hailed as one of the best films of 2001,Witmakes it clear why top-ranking talents seek refuge in the quality programming of HBO. Unhindered by box-office pressures, director Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson turn the most unglamorous topic--the physical and psychological ravages of cancer--into an exquisite contemplation of life, learning, and tenacious, richly expressed humanity. In adapting Margaret Edson's compassionate, Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Nichols and Thompson open up the one-room setting with a superb supporting cast. But their focus remains on the hospital experience of Vivian (Thompson), a fiercely demanding professor of English literature whose academic specialty--the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--is the armor she wears against the cruel indignities of her cancer treatment. While losing all that she held dear, she reassesses her life as an aloof intellectual, andWitilluminates her bracingly eloquent and deeply moving struggle for dignity, meaning, and peace at life's ultimate crossroads.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "B00664AM02", "B00067BCBI", "B00000F5MN", "B00BTYJYP8", "0061137596", "B000068MBW", "B00005RDAN", "082633038X", "B005TZFZBU", "B0001CNRAM", "0061230979", "B0007WFUGK", "1573226572", "B00005AQMJ", "B00003CXC9", "0826330371", "B0007LFPJ8", "082221704X", "032308334X", "B00000IQV7", "B00B8X4WBG", "B004YCKKIM", "0553210351", "0971907498", "B00AEBB9FA", "B000TV1ST2", "B00KMULA9I", "1468014315", "B004QL7KKC", "B0001I2BUI", "B004AE3QYE", "B0043X1FL8", "0965464911", "B004OE9P2C", "B001OQCV1K", "0679742441", "B002D755AI", "0345425979", "B00008L3SE", "B00J5LXQKQ", "B000R7HY00", "B00BTYHBX0", "B0073U2EWM", "1451624123", "B0063HO5C8", "0803617844", "B005DXCOY4", "B00K6D1SAC", "B0007QJ1W0", "B000063ING", "B0002J4X20", "B00AEBB8YM", "1605477303", "0135080908", "1451667256", "0767821432", "0763765422", "1449649009", "B001TKNWUU", "B001GF8WPI", "0132706687", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B00006L92W", "B007CK3NYG", "B0006IIPM6", "B00005JKWX", "0375757759", "B0015OKWKI", "B0000714BZ", "B000K7VHQE", "0787976385", "B0011V7PSC", "0763773840", "B00004TJKK", "B0015OKWKS", "B000F1IQNM", "B0013K2ZGI", "0095234772", "B0007P0YKY", "B0000CE684", "0470959584", "B00005YUO1", "0140422099", "B00GUO2SKA", "0801478731", "0767805712", "B000H0MKOC", "B0018YCF50", "0783227906", "0826157912", "0064430189", "B00AEFYSWM", "1594733120", "B00000JMOF", "0060775823", "1558101764", "B00003CX8U", "B00005BCK9"], "bought_together": ["0571198775"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BTYJYP8", "0571198775", "B00008L3U4", "0826330371"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 12441}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00005MKKV", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MQWHl-FRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wit"}

{"description": "If a top-level spy decided he didn't want to be a spy anymore, could he just walk into HQ and hand in his resignation? With all that classified knowledge in his head, would he be allowed to become a civilian again, free to go about his life? The answer, according to the stylish, brilliantly conceived 1960s British TV seriesThe Prisoner, is a resounding no. In fact, instead of receiving a gold watch for his years of faithful service, our hero (played by Patrick McGoohan) is followed home to his London flat and knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself in a picturesque village where everyone is known by a number. Where is it? Why was he brought here? And, most important, how does he leave?As we learn in Episode 1, Number 6 can't leave. The Village's \"citizens\" might dress colorfully and stroll around its manicured gardens while a band plays bouncy Strauss marches, but the place is actually a prison. Surveillance is near total, and if all else fails, there's always the large, mysterious white ball that subdues potential escapees by temporarily smothering them. Who runs the Village? An ever-changing Number 2, who wants to know why Number 6 resigned. If he'd only cooperate, he's told, life can be made very pleasant. \"I've resigned,\" he fumes. \"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered. My life is my own.\" So sets the stage for the ultimate battle of wills: Number 6's struggle to retain his privacy, sanity, and individuality against the array of psychological and physical methods the Village uses to break him.So does he ever escape? And does he ever find out who Number 1 is? \"Questions are a burden to others,\" the Village saying goes. \"Answers, a prison for oneself.\" Within this complete 17-episode set (which contains the entire series), all is revealed. Or is it?--Steve Landau", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000KLQUT4", "B00E5G03I4", "B002U0KHNS", "B00KTZALDC", "B00005JM5Z", "B00CPTUNR4", "0446387444", "B0000A14WG", "B000NOIX66", "0956632920", "B001CQONOA", "B0000AZKJ8", "B001B0H7DG", "B003K1NGXE", "B005JJCMNU", "B005DKS1Z8", "B008MIYKS0", "B0007CEXUY", "B000UX6TJI", "B0012EBV8I", "B008X8VM1W", "B00CPR3RB0", "B0014BQR3I", "B001DW2BG0", "B001WLMOL4", "B00005JNU5", "B00IO998U2", "B000UX6TKC", "B00005JP4N", "B001HUHBBS", "B000HT3PF6", "B00E96AY20", "B000EXDS2A", "B00EC9UHVM", "B0027EZS90", "B00000IREA", "B006MFQ4OS", "B002L9N4E2", "B00105307O", "B003NOGNQU", "B00264QI68", "B000LE16Y4", "B00144P9RA", "B001DHXT6G", "B0002F6BSS", "B000E991A2", "B000H5U5EE", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B0028S110K", "B001LMAK6A", "B0001MZ7J6", "B002LFPAUC", "B000ERVJKO", "B004132HZS", "B00F6D62O4", "B00CDEJRDC", "B004VW4VAI", "B00114XLZK", "B0009XRZ92", "B0002MHDW4", "B001J710Y8", "B00C6ACWLC", "B001C71IGA", "B000T9OP7G", "B000FIHN8O", "B004L9GMBC", "B00E3UN44W", "B000ZBEOHY", "B000BZISS0", "B000ATQYWY", "B0009JE6G6", "B008B37CB8", "B003ZEQMH8", "B001XRLWLU", "B000055Y0X", "B0006UEVTK", "B004QOB8SO", "B00F3L8P26", "B006JY3OHW", "B002OID4T0", "B001GMH8WE", "B001MVWMD4", "B000V3JGIS", "B00AMSTXSU", "B0003JAOO0", "B00005JKEX", "B000RPD0DM", "B00AEBB8VK", "B002Q3MYA8", "B001DHXT48", "B00EJ1IT4A", "B00BMJ7ZKG", "B004PQM81E", "B00HT2RTU6", "B005X4P3DC", "B002LFQIL2", "B00AZMFJYA", "B008FTX6PO", "B0027CSMY0", "B00026L7OU"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00E5G03I4", "B00004Y7DZ", "B001DHXT6G", "B002U0KHNS"]}, "price": 179.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 163816}, "asin": "B00005NKCQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515RHT85P1L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "The Complete Prisoner Megaset"}

{"description": "Without question, 3-D technology has come a long way since the days of  red and green cardboard glasses, andAlien Adventureoffers ample  proof. This roughly 30-minute feature--also available inThe Ultimate 3-D  Collection, which includes two other films and the H3D  \"i-glasses\" hardware needed to generate the 3-D imaging--tells the story  of alien pioneers inadvertently discovering Earth through a high-tech  amusement park. The story is mindless, but the sense of depth conveyed  here is quite convincing, especially during the many point-of-view  sequences. The image and color resolution of the digital animation  leaves much to be desired, however, proving unrewarding in 2-D.That said, certain sequences shine, most notably a lengthy slide through  an arctic wonderland of vast nighttime icescapes and narrow roads  through head-spinning chasms. The sound is well above average, enhancing  the sense of real-life depth with seamless DTS surround mixes that  work well even in headphones.--Michael Mikesell", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00005QCX3", "B00005QCWW", "B001GJ4U96", "B008DL4HXE", "B0052WNHQU", "B000RSQ8FG", "B00IKM5N1G", "B003Z2LAAO", "B0043VUHXC", "B00008W2NT", "B00079Z9W8", "B007RZJ3MW", "B00F3OLVTM", "B00B4804KS", "B004EPZ0B6", "B008XBCJ34", "B004U7MQVK", "B000AGTPUK", "B0007CHPPY", "B005SN3INA", "B005HP2JAM", "B005LAIII0", "B00447G2O8", "B0029R81J4", "B009AMAH9I", "B00428CCO8", "B00C2PO09I", "B005FLSZRO", "B00005QCX0", "B004YOEFG8", "B005LAII80", "B009INALBS", "B008RZPCYY", "B0007GBBVO", "B004AKCMD4", "B004XZ99LO", "B0062KMDZ2", "B004LWZW6U", "B005ELVCVQ", "B003ZZEM8S", "B000VCLH40", "B000TXPXC8", "B000FP8NGS", "B0076XTH4Y", "B005OKOUIE"], "bought_together": ["B00005QCX3", "B00005QCWW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009YQJ322", "B0044XV3R8", "B00379AHDQ", "B00AO3DTJ2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 67946}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 24.5, "brand": "", "asin": "B00005QCX4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516XB9871AL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Alien Adventure (3D)"}

{"description": "Grigory Chukhraj's poetic odyssey of an accidental hero on a six-day pass is a sentimental journey through the ideals of the Soviet state in World War II. Vladimir Ivashov is the fresh-faced signalman whose trip from the Russian front to visit his white-haired mother becomes a series of detours as he stops to help the loyal comrades, fellow soldiers, and salt-of-the-earth civilians (as well as a few shirkers and scoundrels) he meets along the way. On a transport train he even falls in love with a pretty young stowaway, a feisty blond girl-next-door on her way to visit a wounded boyfriend. Delicately photographed and gently paced, this deliriously romantic road movie is undeniably Soviet in its celebration of patriotism and collectivism, but Chukhraj transcends politics with delightfully vivid characters and a deft mix of comedy, melodrama, and romance.--Sean Axmaker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000633SD", "B000K2UEDG", "B006ML50YC", "B00019G4TQ", "B0002KQOH6", "6305257450", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00KIZY3XW", "B000PKG6OO", "B000LV6OHQ", "B006ML50S8", "B00280QNK6", "6305744114", "B003OXGW5M", "B000V7HFL4", "B0000BWVCR", "B000RTCSIQ", "B00005UQ7R", "B00006LPEK", "B0000YEDM2", "B001D8W7F4", "B0019X3ZZO", "B0009WIE2A", "B00007CVS3", "B001LMU1C8", "B00005V6N6", "B00004XQN5", "B0006HC0F0", "B002QP145C", "0780022343", "B00HRISNPM", "6305081034", "B00GPPXOTS", "B004GNBBVO", "B008CJ0JS4", "B000I8OOG0", "B00AQ6J64O", "B00DHN8GQ2", "B00HVOFP6W", "B00GBT6332", "B00HVOFP9O", "630513104X", "B00HE010QM", "B00006JO77", "B00AQ6J5YA", "B004NWPY20", "B000FUF7D0", "B000QXDFS0", "B00005JLV7", "B0002HOEQC", "B00005NFZD", "B001MPS7GG", "B004U7EIES", "B00IVLR9JA", "B00DZP1BY6", "B00005UQ7Q", "B000067IY7", "B003WKL6YO", "B00D3K357O", "B00005NFZC", "B005HK13P4", "B00F98FOFY", "B000G6L7X2", "B00006673L", "B000WS6YAA", "B000093NR2", "B006TTC5A4", "B00B2BYXWM", "B000BB14I0", "B0009UKV5U", "0780023099", "B000NPQ0GA", "B00GBT62PQ", "B000087EY6", "B000BB14IA", "B00004W3HG", "B001BEK8E2", "B00008H2I1", "B00005BCK0", "B0087OULO6", "B000093NR0", "B000069CF9", "B00004W3HF", "B000NOK0HG", "B00HVOFP08", "B000E1YW9A", "B00007ELDG", "B00005NFZB", "B006X96PBU", "B001BEK8C4", "B00005M2C7", "B00152VXU8", "B000E5LEVA", "B000A9QK7I", "B000PKG6O4", "B00006673M", "B000PKG6P8", "B009RWRIMA", "B0006HC0FU", "B000062XF0"], "bought_together": ["B0000633SD", "B00019G4TQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0000633SD", "B00019G4TQ", "B0000YEDM2", "B006ML50YC"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 69926}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 19.99, "brand": "IVASHOV,VLADIMIR", "asin": "B0000633SB", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GJyl0icqL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Ballad of a Soldier (The Criterion Collection)"}

{"description": "IfBirthday Girlis a far-fetched thriller, it's also a slice of  absurdist fun populated by some awfully interesting actors. Nicole Kidman  plays Sophia, a chain-smoking, mascara-smudged, wildly sexual mail-order bride  from Russia who answers an Internet plea for companionship from a lonely  British bank employee, John (Ben Chaplin). For a while, the two make a  startling and intriguing pair: she apparently speaks no English and he  naively frets over the veracity of the Web business that brought them  together. The gorgeous Kidman and sad-eyed Chaplin are briefly the engine of  their own unique movie, but then the other shoe drops. Sophia, obviously up to  something mysterious, is paid a visit on her birthday by two Russian  \"cousins\" (French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and one of his own frequent  stars, Vincent Cassel, also seen inBrotherhood of the Wolf).  Suddenly, John's quest for a lover becomes a web of deceit and corruption.  Directed and cowritten (with his brother Tom) by Jez Butterworth,Birthday Girlis hampered a bit by sluggishness and insufficient character  development.

{"description": "Like the dashing desperado in an old Hollywood Western, rhinestone-in-the-rough Gene Starwind is a self-proclaimed outlaw who lives by a personal code of ethics. His sphere of action is limited to the two-bit planet where he lives with his friend and business partner Jim Hawking, until rebel pirate \"Hot Ice\" Hilda arrives. She gives Jim and Gene the super-ship, theOutlaw Star, and tells them about a fabulous treasure hidden at the Galactic Leyline. The duo sets off, accompanied by beautiful assassin Suzuka, Malfina, an android who bonds with the ship's fussy computer, and, later, the abrasive alien Aisha Clanclan of the Ctarl-Ctarl Empire. They face some nasty enemies: the Kei Pirates, the MacDougall brothers (Harry, a psychotic cyborg, and Ron, a sadistic human), and Lord Hazanko of the 108 Stars pirate gang. The expedition to the enigmatic planet Galactic Leyline becomes a four-way race that pits Gene and his crew against Hazanko, the MacDougals, and a Ctarl-Ctarl battle cruiser. At the Leyline, Gene, Malfina, and Suzuka confront the pasts that shaped their identities. Katsuhiko Chiba's screenplay sometimes staggers, like Gene the morning after a heavy night. But the characters remain true to their natures: they don't turn into smarmy good guys, andOutlaw Stardelivers an engaging, if rather dark brand of comedy-adventure. The cleanup artists on the series do very sloppy work: Gene's features change noticeably from scene to scene. Rated 13 Up: Nudity, profanity, sexual humor, and violence.--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AUJH32E", "B00102FF7U", "B008NNY9YE", "B008YRL6V8", "B00441GYS8", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B008YRL6WM", "B0053O8B0Y", "B00DNQM7M2", "B0043988G2", "B004DMIIPA", "B00CU6WBMW", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B004GZZH6W", "B008YRL7JO", "B004DMIISM", "B00576U9AS", "B008YRL7JE", "B001CZJP0S", "B001C4ZQEI", "B001K98M4Q", "B004G9UXEY", "B006O94DLI", "B00006HAYG", "B001F2U700", "B008D1RDIU", "B00D39UQ2W", "B00CU6WBOU", "B009AVC922", "B00393SFW0", "B0049TC8C6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CEV3O6", "B00AUJH32E", "B00102FF7U", "B0029XFQF0"]}, "price": 47.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 311487}, "asin": "B00006FD99", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PB09N3MPL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Outlaw Star: Perfect Collection Boxed Set"}

So everyone worries: what will become of Toula? Then one day she sees the ultimate unattainable guy and realizes the only way her life will get better is if he gets away from her big, fat Greek family. Toula escapes from the family restaurant. She exchanges her seating hostess jacket for a college diploma, convinces her aunt to give her a new job, and trades in her coke-bottle glasses for contact lenses, just in time for \"him\" to walk back into her life. Ian Miller is tall, handsome but defnitely not Greek. Their courtship is an Olympian culture clash. Can Ian handle Toula, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins and several centuries of Greek heritage? Will Toula discover the love she's been missing right in the heart of her big, fat family? One thing is for sure, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, with Ian's proposal Toula is headed for her big, fat Greek wedding.", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0021L8UO4", "B000EHRVOW", "B00386EZKE", "B000ELJAEM", "B0013D8LHC", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEBB8NS", "6304765266", "B0000CGNEF", "B00466HN7M", "B00005JG6N", "B000BKVQS4", "B0007RT9M6", "B0009OL7Z4", "B0038N9X3Q", "6305236569", "B002ZG988M", "B001AKTZW8", "B00006ZXSL", "B000YDBPAM", "B0015I2RT8", "B001TUZD8O", "B0000AOV4I", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000MQC9H4", "B00007E2F5", "B002ZG989G", "B0001AVZA8", "B0000897EG", "B00AEFXYOA", "B004SIP9RO", "B0007PLLBU", "B000OCZA04", "B00008NRI7", "B001GKJ2DY", "B002K0WBXW", "B00008G7UF", "B008R65XMO", "B000A343RI", "B001ECDVK4", "B0000VD02Y", "B000023VTP", "B001Y8DJVE", "B002ZG9968", "B003BV8ICC", "B0001XALGY", "B003B3V0N4", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006ZXSK", "B002U4UYZA", "B002U1LGTQ", "B00005JN3W", "B003Y5H524", "B000GETTIE", "B000J103OI", "B00DW5IJR6", "B00003CXC3", "B00AEFY99O", "B00AEBBA2M", "B001LMAK9W", "B0042816YK", "B006VRRGQ2", "B000JU8H9C", "B004IK30PA", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B005LAIGXW", "B0000B1OFL", "B00158K0QU", "B004SIP9VA", "B00006ZXSQ", "6305428352", "B005Z9MFRC", "B000K7VHTQ", "B000Z8GZYW", "B00AEFY5TI", "0767810856", "B0001I55M4", "B004SIP8LG", "B000FOPPC4", "B000E6EHE0", "B00005JPSM", "0800177258", "6305428387", "6305803781", "B004EPZ070", "0800141849"], "bought_together": ["B00386EZKE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00386EZKE", "B00466HN7M", "B0021L8UO4", "B0009OL7Z4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 2192}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B00006FMUW", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EhfedTTUL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"}

Despite the sometimes-laughable production values and a few gaping holes in the plot, Malcolm Hulke's script contains enough intrigue and incident to keep the whole thing moving briskly for six episodes. \"Colony in Space\" was significant for being the Third Doctor's first adventure away from Earth, fitting into the eighth season after \"The Claws of Axos.\" Though less celebrated than \"The Demons,\" this is an entertaining adventure and a reminder of just how muchDoctor Whoreflected the radical politics of 1970s British sci-fi.--Gary S.

These darned suspicious circumstances lead Pym to hire Lord Peter Wimsey to determine whether Dean's death was an accident or murder or eh, what? Ian Carmichael returns in his signature role as Dorothy L. Sayers's aristocratic sleuth in this characteristically impeccable 1973 BBC miniseries. The chaotic advertising agency is a ripe setting for intrigue (Sayers herself worked in a prominent London ad agency in the 1920s). Wimsey has a high time masquerading incognito as the firm's new copywriter, as well as the mysterious costumed Harlequin, a ruse he adopts to obtain information from the notorious socialite Dian de Momerie (Bridget Armstrong), whose lovers (Dean, among them) all come to bad ends, and whose den of iniquity is fronted by Major Milligan (Peter Bowles, ofTo the Manor Born), a drug dealer who corrupts bright young things.Among the pleasures of a Wimsey mystery is his panache with the niceties of our English tongue. At one point he observes, \"Truth in advertising is like lemon in three measures of meal. It produces a suitable quantity of gas with which to blow out a mass of crude misrepresentations into a format the public can swallow.\" Let's see Nick Charles or Columbo wrap his tongue around that one.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B00BDSRM4K", "045000242X", "B00005MFIL", "B000062XDX", "B002TY78PU", "B00009WNVN", "B000056C0K", "B00005RIWV", "B00008DDXE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BDSRM4K", "045000242X", "B00005MFIL", "B000062XDX"]}, "price": 30.49, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 280488}, "asin": "B00007E1WX", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512BASX295L._SX300_.jpg", "title": "Lord Peter Wimsey - Murder Must Advertise"}

{"description": "Kate Hudson twinkles as the heroine of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. She's a magazine writer assigned to date a guy, make all the mistakes girls make that drive guys away (being clingy, talking in baby-talk and so on) and records the process like a sociological experiment. However, the guy she picks-- Matthew McConaughey--is an advertising executive who's just bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days; if he succeeds, he'll win a huge account that will make his career. The set-up is completely absurd, but the collision of their efforts to woo and repel creates some pretty funny scenes. McConaughey's easy charm and Hudson's lightweight impishness play well together and the plot, though strictly Hollywood formula, chugs along efficiently. At moments Hudson seems to channel her mother, Goldie Hawn, to slightly unnerving effect. --Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007E2F5", "B00003CXSM", "B00AEFXWXI", "B0012KJ0DK", "B002K0WBXW", "B0015I2RT8", "B00164KYV4", "B004EPZ070", "B0000897EG", "B00447L4KA", "B002P413IC", "B00005JN3W", "B002ZG988M", "B000MQC9H4", "B002ZG989G", "B00AEBB8NS", "B000A343RI", "B001TUZD8O", "B00006ZXSL", "B00005O5CM", "B001OQCUZM", "B004EPZ0BG", "B00081U7HC", "B004SIP9X8", "B003Y5H574", "B001Y8DJVE", "6304765266", "B00008NRI7", "B000YDBPAM", "B0038N9X3Q", "B00AEBB8R4", "B00AEFYQE2", "B000683VI4", "B0000524E5", "B00AEBB9WI", "B00AEFXO8Q", "B00AEFYM2S", "B000YAA68C", "B00AMEZDJW", "B0007PLLBU", "B00006ZXSK", "B002ZG984Q", "B0009OL7Z4", "B002ZG9968", "B0036TGSIK", "B000023VTP", "B003BV8ICC", "B00AEFYWQY", "B00AEBB8YW", "B000J4QW7W", "B003B3V0N4", "B00005JG6N", "B0000DIXDR", "B004SEUJK0", "B005LAIGSM", "B000ELJAEM", "B0001Z3TXE", "B000957O82", "B001OQCUYI", "B004SIP9RO", "B004SIP8LG", "B003NHRIVQ", "B0013D8LHC", "B00AKGG6JS", "B00008WJD6", "B003Y5H524", "B000J103OI", "B0050MB584", "B00006ZXSO", "B00006FMUW", "B000HEWEE4", "6305236569", "B000XJD33O", "B002ZG99UE", "B0035Q637K", "B00466HN7M", "B001L9EXTS", "B00386EZKE", "B001C5LLQ4", "076780421X", "B000J3OTSM", "B000E6EHE0", "B004LWZW9C", "B00005JM55", "B000EMGICS", "B000CEV3KU", "B008JFUUIA", "B00003CXMP", "B000P0J0DS", "B000TZJBPQ", "B0000AOV4I", "B005Z9MFRC", "B0000D8L1K", "B000HCPS94", "B00E8RKHWW", "B00AEFY4CG", "B004SIP8JI", "B0001AVZA8", "B005LAIGXW", "B000Y7U93C"], "bought_together": ["B00007E2F5", "B002K0WBXW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002K0WBXW", "B002ZG989G", "B00007E2F5", "B00447L4KA"]}, "price": 14.16, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 346003}, "asin": "B00008KDGZ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512083xZEbL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"}
{"description": "In this 1998 television series, fourbishonen(beautiful boys) work as  florists to cover their activities as the vigilante posseWei&#xDF; Kreuz,  the Knights of the White Cross. Ex-soccer pro Ken fights with a ninja claw;  self-styled ladies' man Yoji uses nooses; computer ace Omi fires poison darts  and crossbow bolts; sullen, taciturn Aya wields a traditional samurai sword.  The Knights assassinate murderers, kidnappers, and sexual predators when their  hidden superiors tell them, \"Hunters of the Night, Deny these Dark Beasts  their tomorrows.\"Knight Huntersbegins as a sort of male version ofBubblegum  Crisis, with the dedicated quartet squabbling among themselves before  they fight as a unit. But after the first few episodes, it turns into an  elaborate and bloody soap opera of vengeance, hidden identities, and old  family wrongs that must be righted. Their main target in the first adventure  is the evil Masafumi Takatori, who tries to assume dictatorial powers when  he's elected Prime Minister. After Takatori's murder, the series grows increasingly bizarre with  supernatural and satanic elements. The Knights have to take out a musician  whose songs induce insanity, a serial kidnapper, a trio of cult leaders, and  the still-active agents of Takatori. The last episodes are heavily padded,  and the ending is a classic cliffhanger, leaving open the possibility of  additional adventures--should anyone be interested. (Rated 13 and older, but  more appropriate for 16 and older: violence, violence against women, brief  nudity, sexual situations, grotesque imagery, torture, alcohol and tobacco  use)--Charles Solomon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BB18K4", "B007BMIGII", "B00F9F975A", "B003NE8B6A", "B004XC5LPA", "B008NNY9YE", "B00CU6WBMW", "B00BQ1DDUG", "B00HFC547A", "B00AUJH32E", "B00GS19OOS", "B005W2BWSA", "B00HFC30A8", "B008D1RDLM", "B0030BOCKA", "B005W2BW5S", "B00BCPOEI6", "B00G0OM3EG", "B00BLQRG8G", "B005NQ5LL4", "B004VLLWA6", "B00CDV4R26", "B004GZZH6W", "B000F6ZIFQ", "B00AUJH3GA", "B002FOQXSM", "B001F2U700", "B000KF0P1Y", "B00B1RB8ZC", "B009LDCUP0", "B000NIBUXU", "B004JST244", "B003VRRW7S", "B0023S4A1W", "B008DL4MFW", "B00151QYJ4", "B001GTFP2M", "B002EP8TSO", "B009AVC9N6", "B008XEZXQQ", "B008KZX7YI", "B003H6KRPM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002EP8TSO", "B000BB18K4", "B002MXZYDG", "B005HVWVU4"]}, "price": 39.31, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 248672}, "asin": "B00008QSBA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518NGHFDS2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Knight Hunters - Complete Collection"}

{"description": "If disconnected glimpses of classic horror-movie visions were all it took,Horrorwould easily be counted a low-budget masterpiece. New Jersey-born filmmaker Dante Tomaselli (who certainly has a great name for a horror movie director) has obviously studied the imagery of theBava-Argentoline of Italian horror, and he's conjured some genuinely creepy sights:  a black goat standing in the snow, a doll's head melting, a girl sliding silently from beneath a bed. This stuff gets under your skin, no doubt, but it would be nice if Tomaselli supplied some coherent reason to be watching all this. Girl-in-peril Lizzy Mahon is a cut above the generally awkward acting, but the top-lined performer is the Amazing Kreskin, whose kooky mentalism hugger-mugger is cleverly incorporated into his role as a faith-healing preacher. (Tomaselli has Kreskin, Ed Wood had Criswell&#x85;discuss.)

{"description": "The eighth season ofThe X-Fileswill always be remembered as the year of brave decisions. David Duchovny's increasing dissatisfaction with the role meant he'd only appear in a few episodes. The solution? Enter Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) who basically stole the show within his first two minutes of screen time (and watch out for severalTerminator 2in-jokes too!). Scully (Gillian Anderson) switched roles to being the believer alongside Doggett's skeptic in a year that was more reliant on the background story arc than ever before. Her pregnancy remained at the foreground, while a more prominent Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) joined in a hunt for the abducted Mulder that drew upon the black oil, cloning, and bounty-hunting aspects of the convoluted alien conspiracy story. A distinct lack of guest stars or writers indicated maturity beyond the need for ratings stunts: dedicated fans were pleased to see sinister Krycek, the reliable Lone Gunmen, and the return of the show's very first abductee. The real strengths of the season came from new characters, including alternative female role model Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and some terrific standalone episodes. Investigations covered a man going backward in time, deaths aboard an oil rig, a contagion in the Boston subway tunnels, and creatures resembling bats and slugs. Agent Leyla Harrison (named after anX-Filesfan who died of cancer) got to ask all the petty questions regular viewers want to know themselves. With season 9 promised to be the last, this year was a remarkable achievement so late in a show's life.--Paul Tonks", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EXDS3Y", "B000EXDS34", "B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0T2", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000BOH98G", "B000BOH986", "B0007X7044", "B001FACH7S", "B001G7PSZI", "B0006UEVUE", "B001G7PT4I", "B001CY5N00", "B003V1IU3O", "B001G7PSSK", "B000244E2O", "B001G0MFIS", "B00KC57IWG", "B00465I156", "B0009X76XW", "B001CQONKY", "B00FXW9664", "B000UX6TIE", "B000SULWKO", "B001MVWRNE", "B003FSTN5M", "B0002CX1M0", "B00IWTVDUW", "B00GTZWZH6", "B006LG74RE", "B004X60QE2", "B000063V8R", "B00064VQXA", "1613777515", "1933784725", "B009LDD5XQ", "B000CQM4YM", "B0070DERD6", "B00129W6LE", "B0007UDCX0", "B001HUHBBS", "B000F8O2PG", "B00DYQ1GBE", "B001MVWRMU", "B00005Y1NF", "B005CFC04W", "B0036EH3X4", "B0019N95IK", "B00AGKHBZ6", "B000FGGE7C", "B00133QNSG", "B00005JM3A", "B002BWP2IK", "B000H7JCGY", "B001MVWRN4", "B003L77GWE", "B000AQ68X2", "B006TBYC76", "B001DXS4DI", "B00008972G", "1613777183", "6305767866", "B000B8I9ZO", "B000002N8O", "B00CHZ236K", "B0009NZ2RE", "B001C4CI8U", "B00022FWEU", "B000P0J0BU", "B000A88EU0", "B000W4KT9G", "B007STBUHI", "1613779445", "0783225725", "B00GX7D5JW", "B0009X7646", "B001AQR39O", "B000H1RFXM", "B00J5JSV1W", "B000B8IA08", "B008LCRABQ", "B000Q6GUW0", "B0057FGD3Q", "B003YF9Q08", "B00IQ8TT82", "B000O77SMW", "B000FBH3WM", "B000NDEXKW", "B009NH6AOQ", "6303961614", "B005FISBTO", "B008LCRAC0", "B000NOIX66", "B001L5SRJE", "B00J2R3W52", "B0002NY8GW", "B003R0MEZO", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00BTYPW7C"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000CNE0TC", "B000CNE0SS", "B000BOH990", "B000CNE0T2"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72854}, "asin": "B00008YGRY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51N2NNAHHBL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season"}

{"description": "\"Matters of Honor\" launchedBabylon 5's third season with the introduction of theWhite Star, a spacecraft added to enable more of the action to take place away from the station. Also introduced was Marcus Cole (Jason Carter)--in another nod toThe Lord of the Rings, a Ranger not so far removed from Tolkien's Strider. In \"Voices of Authority\" the show finds an epic scale as Ivanova seeks the mysterious \"First Ones\" for allies against the Shadows, and evidence is discovered pointing to the truth behind President Santiago's assassination. A third of the way through the season \"Messages from Earth,\" \"Point of No Return,\" and \"Severed Dreams\" prove pivotal, changing the nature of the story in a way previously unimaginable on network TV. Earth slides into dictatorship, the fascistic Nightwatch takes control of off-world security, and Sheridan take decisive action by declaring Babylon 5 independent.\"Interludes and Examinations\" presented the death of a major supporting character, while the two-part \"War Without End\" reached apocalyptic dimensions in a complex tale resolving the destiny of Sinclair and the fate ofBabylon 4(dovetailing elegantly with the events of thefirst season's \"Babylon Squared\"), resolving a 1,000-year-old paradox and presenting a vision of a very dark future for Sheridan and Delenn. All this was trumped by the monumental \"Z'ha'dum.\" In the preceding \"Shadow Dancing\" Anna Sheridan (Melissa Gilbert, Bruce Boxleitner's real-life wife) returned from the dead, no longer entirely human. In the mythologically resonant climax Anna invited Sheridan back to the Shadow homeworld with no hope of survival. Just as inThe Lord of the RingsGandalf fell into the abyss at Khazad-Dum, so Sheridan took a comparable leap into the unknown on an alien world.--Gary S.

{"description": "Nobody would argue with the thought that Sissy Spacek is the perfect heroine of Stephen King's scary tale of teenage telekinesis. But in a pinch, Angela Bettis, the star of this 2002 TV remake, fills Spacek's bloody shoes very well. Bettis--who expertly plays a similar role in the indie horror picMay--gets all the loner pathos of poor Carrie White, equally tormented by her cool classmates and her religious-fanatic mom (Patricia Clarkson). Her transformation from doormat to vengeful prom queen remains surefire wish fulfillment for anyone who ever felt a misfit in high school. Despite Bettis's intensity, it's difficult to justify remakingCarriewhenBrian De Palma's 1976 versionis enshrined as a classic of its kind (especially given the pedestrian TV-movie production values on display here).

{"description": "This low-key, thoroughly delightful comedy is the product of Scottish comic/actor/writer/director Craig Ferguson's goofy and sweet imagination. Ferguson plays retired rock star Paul Kerr, a 1980s sensation whose whiskey-fueled antics in a Welsh mansion land him, involuntarily, in a psychiatric hospital. In short order, an old bandmate (Ralph Brown) turns up to help Paul get sober, and a long-lost love (Jemma Redgrave) introduces the mortified musician to an adolescent daughter (Charlotte Church) he never knew he had. Lots of catching up and relationship repairs ensue, but the film is really an off-center, eccentric comedy in which quaint villagers debate the origins of guitar feedback and 75-year-old veteran actor Joss Ackland (Surviving Picasso) can be found performing Roy Orbison rockers. A pleasant surprise is golden-throated Church's acting debut; revered for years as a singing prodigy, she proves to be a natural actress and outstanding pop-song stylist.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["0790748460", "B00003CXMY", "B000063K0J", "B005FHHD58", "B00CQRNLLU", "B001NFNFIU", "B000Z27HFE", "B0040JHF32", "B001053024", "B00007CVRM", "B00FBQ38VQ", "B00005Y6XP", "1573301469", "B0009U5DCQ", "0811853756", "B00005AUGM", "0061998494", "B00004ZDPO", "B00000I9CF", "B00002EPP9", "0811858197", "B000053VAE", "B0041QSZGU", "B004IY6AS0", "0061719544", "B000CSRSGY", "B0019BI19Q", "B000002PEY", "B007K7IBTI", "B0060RU2QO", "B00472O3C8", "B0007VCUGO", "B00FPPQYXM", "B00005NFY6", "B002I5GNZQ", "0752893394", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B0009PBLU4", "B00BTYU3QW", "B000G0F13K", "6305588236", "B00000ILEC", "B00008DDVT", "B002WY65UQ", "B008R3EYWM", "B0026RX2VE", "B00007GZZW", "B00005JLJC", "B002GOAH1U", "B0009OJ9R2", "B003OOH444", "B00AZMFO6I"], "bought_together": ["B00003CXMY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00003CXMY", "B00000I9CF", "0790748460", "B005MWPW86"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 47897}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 4.79, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0000TG492", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51538Xcdj5L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "I'll Be There"}
{"description": "TheAlien Quadrilogyis a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the fourAlienfilms. Although previously available on DVD as theAlien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form.Alien(1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron'sAliens(1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternativeAlien 3(1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different.Alien: Resurrection(1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer.TheAlien Quadrilogyoffers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the firstAlienDVD release are missing here.Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by theLord of the Ringsextended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the oldAlienlaserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe theAlien Quadrilogy, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time.--Gary S.

Stan Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin) are gone, leaving Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Kay Howard (Melissa Leo) without partners.

The loquacious Lewis, on his own since thethird-seasondeparture of Steve Crosetti (Jon Polito), has finally found the perfect sparring partner, while Kellerman would add some redheaded sex appeal to the acclaimed drama (hey, it worked forNYPD Blue).Another new character, naive crime-scene videographer James Brodie (Max Perlich), makes his (somewhat shambolic) entrance in \"Autofocus.\" All the other old favorites are back: Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and wife Mary (Braugher&#x92;s real-life spouse Ami Brabson), for instance, are expecting a baby, and the much-married John Munch (Richard Beltzer) is dating the new medical examiner. Interesting developments are in store for the rest of the unit, as well, including a change in location (due to a gas leak) and command (Howard is promoted, but Isabella Hofman's Captain Russert is demoted).Notable episodes include \"A Doll's Eyes,\" a look at a murder case from the perspective of the victim's family (with Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden); \"Heartbeat,\" inspired by Edgar Allen Poe's \"Tell-Tale Heart\"; and \"Thrill of the Kill,\" an eerie tale about a spree killer with a split personality.

{"description": "As upscale sitcoms go,Something's Gotta Givehas more to offer than most romantic comedies. Obviously working through some semi-autobiographical issues regarding \"women of a certain age,\" writer-director Nancy Meyers brings adequate credibility and above-average intelligence to what is essentially (but not exclusively) a fantasy premise, in which an aging lothario who's always dated younger women (Jack Nicholson, more or less playing himself) falls for a successful middle-aged playwright (Diane Keaton) who's convinced she's past the age of romance, much less sexual re-awakening. As long as old pals Nicholson and Keaton are on screen discussing their dilemma or discovering their mutual desire,Something's Gotta Giveis terrific, proving (in case anyone had forgotten) that Hollywood can and should aim for an older demographic. Myers falls short with the sitcom device of a younger lover (Keanu Reeves) who wants Keaton as much as Nicholson does; it's believable but shallow and too easily dismissed. Myers also skimps on supporting roles for Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, and Jon Favreau, but thankfully this is one romantic comedy that doesn't pander to youth.

{"description": "Unlikely romance is the subject ofPassionada, an atmospheric piece just offbeat enough to be likable. Set in the flavorful Portuguese fishing community in New Bedford, the film offers two quirky lovers. The beautiful Sofia Milos plays a skeptical widow, sternly raising a teenage daughter (Emmy Rossum), who nevertheless shows her passionate side when she sings traditional Portuguese fado songs at night. Jason Isaacs, veteran of many villain roles (The Patriot,Peter Pan), is a gambler new to town, who is suitably entranced by this lady's singing (though he must hide his profession if he wants a chance with her). The story has its rocky moments, but director Dan Ireland (The Whole Wide World) lets the actors work up some winning chemistry together, and the sultrysoundtrackhelps; the fado singing is dubbed by Misia.

{"description": "The Waltons' nearly 10-year run on network television grew out of the popular, 1971 made-for-TV movieThe Homecoming, which was derived from a Depression-era, rustic setting (\"Walton's Mountain\"), and characters based on Earl Hamner Jr.'sautobiographical novelSpencer's Mountain--itself the source for a very nice1963 feature filmstarring Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara.  That's a lot of entertainment sprouting from Hamner's prose. But something about his seminal story of family values, rugged independence, and big dreams amidst a hardscrabble existence captured the hearts of American audiences, many of whom personally recalled severe economic adversity in the 1930s.The Waltons: The Complete First Seasoncollects those initial episodes from the series building on the strengths of theHomecomingpilot, which introduced the extended Walton clan led by a strong-willed mill owner, John (Andrew Duggan), and his equally resolute wife, Olivia (Patricia Neal).The Waltonsrecast those key roles (as well as a few others) with Ralph Waite and Michael Learned (yup, a female), but Richard Thomas carried over as oldest child John-Boy Walton, an aspiring writer whose cusp-of-manhood view informs the series. Will Geer (Seconds) replaced Edgar Bergen as Grandpa Walton, Ellen Corby remained as Grandma, and John and Olivia's large brood (seven kids in all) were filled out by largely unknown, young actors. The episodes, still delightful and touching, strong on production values and unusually tight and polished for primetime drama, tended to focus on creator Hamner's pet themes of self-sacrifice and heroic effort when the going got tough.Year 1 highlights include \"The Carnival,\" in which the impoverished Waltons, who can't pay for tickets to see a circus performance, end up sheltering stranded carney folk. \"The Typewriter\" is a classic about John-Boy \"borrowing\" a museum's antique typewriter, only to have his sister Mary Ellen (Judy Norton) sell it as junk. \"The Sinner\" concerns the arrival of a fundamentalist minister on Walton's Mountain, finding comfort in the words of religious iconoclast John Walton after the clergyman makes a fool of himself with moonshine. That's Hamner himself providing touches of narration. During the long run of the multiple-award-winningThe Waltons, there were many changes in casting and storylines. But this boxed set reveals a fine series in its pristine state.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00650RXFE", "B00650RX72", "B00650RWGO", "B00650RWZA", "B00650RX90", "B0026ZQBK0", "B00127IU4S", "B001F7AQDS", "B001E549KC", "B0000AQS5E", "B000MQ58WM", "B000JBWWOC", "B006WPZUJS", "B00HVFA36I", "B00HR2WIM2", "B00009AVA5", "1581822987", "B00009QG5P", "B0000C2IVT", "B00BUWD7NE", "B0002NY8PI", "B00016JE5U", "B0001WNL2G", "B003XJABWM", "B0007WFXIK", "B00E96AWY0", "B0002KVUS4", "B000PHX5KU", "B000AA4KQ0", "B00069FKZU", "B00HR2HTRQ", "B0000V4906", "B000GIXCFQ", "B00005JO4F", "B001E6JC30", "B004H91APO", "B0007V6IWQ", "B0050MB5AC", "B000B5XOUM", "B006ZL1P84", "B0002W4SX6", "B0002ERWVE", "B00009QG5T", "B008WAM2DI", "B000A0GORS", "B000291Q3Y", "B0002VEYV8", "B002E58FT2", "B000B8I9ZY", "B0009I7NH6", "B005M2A4CA", "B0009UC7MK", "B0007TKHFM", "B000YKYT1M", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0000AZT5P", "B000068V9Y", "B00006J6XH", "B000B7HZUK", "B000FSMEB0", "B000CCBCHQ", "B008K1PWMW", "B00ISZNCKE", "B00GOC75V0", "B00005V1XH", "B0007Y08P6", "1568490224", "B008KZX7W0", "B000EHSVB4", "B000HEZEYG", "B0009UC80G", "B00005JOEB", "B00IEPIYCO", "B000LC4ZBC", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000E33VZ4", "B000EGDANO", "B000EQ46HI", "B0007KIFK0", "B000FSME10", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B000CQM4YM", "B008D9NI54", "B00GOC75YW", "B000LV6VZQ", "B0002W4SWW", "B00005JNS8", "B005F96UP0", "B000EBGE82", "B000EBGFQI", "B000VDDDZA", "089966945X", "B003VMFX2E", "B000B6CODY", "B0002IQKAY", "B000LE16VC", "0758263678", "B004H91ATA", "B001BN4WHW"], "bought_together": ["B00650RXFE", "B00650RX72"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HR2HTRQ", "B00650RX72", "B00650RWGO", "B00650RWZA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 9831}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 12.19, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B0001DMXEC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61iWI7sZPHL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Waltons: Season 1"}

But the  movie's core are the fascinating, devastating interviews with Wuornos  herself, alternately lucid and delusional as she obsesses about the  police, whom she believes allowed her murders to happen to increase the  potential for profit from movies and books about the case.

{"description": "A complete delight for fans of psychotronic cinema and the Saturday-afternoon creature feature. Writer-director Larry Blamire has distilled every clich&#xE9; of the drive-in movie era of low-budget horror and put it intoThe Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, 90 minutes of pitch-perfect spoofing. The dialogue is marvelously insipid, and the music (taken from a stock music library) cuts in and out of the action with breathtaking suddenness. It was even shot in Bronson Canyon, location of many a cheap B-picture (one knock: the black-and-white image, shot on video, wears the eye out after a while). Aliens from Mars crash-land, setting loose a mutant, while a mad scientist re-awakens a talking skeleton that could hold the key to world domination. And don't forget Animala, a half-woman, half-animal beatnik! Rowwwr! Blamire allows it all to run on too long, yet hardcore fans of this movie world will be hard-pressed to complain.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG", "B004N5UTUO", "B000A2X3RK", "B0015LPS2I", "B00465I1BK", "B00005R1O7", "B000C20VNM", "B0000AGWK2", "B001XW7ICW", "B002TCRQRC", "B00JGR3MIK", "B005HIBWBG", "B0007R4T26", "B001PPGAN0", "B00FQPLZ08", "B00FMVV416", "B008UFUL6K", "B005TMY00K", "B001TH16HO", "6305760403", "B00C7A8WZQ", "B006YKW8WI", "B000UAFDR0", "B003WKL6XA", "B00004Y7GR", "B004RPQSNM", "B005HI4LMS", "B000TJ6PB0", "B00D9EJFZA", "B0085X315U", "B00GSTHBTK", "B001HPOJ68", "B003CNQPO2", "B000FKO3EY", "B00FERT0PK", "B003CNQPOC", "6305944288", "B000FFJZO2", "B0002W4TNA", "B009XY1X9G", "B0000648YD", "6305869367", "6305772681", "B00EMAGIKU", "B006LMRMMA", "6305772711", "6305297223", "B0052G4P26", "B0000694WH", "B00005ASPE", "B00C7E3E6E", "B0034PWPHY", "B00B0LKVIY", "B00358MG8S", "B004CZZZQI", "B00023P4UQ", "B000VJE1NW", "B0000A02TY", "B00480OC0C", "B005M5OS74", "B00DOZNGC2", "B001BSBBGC", "B00AJXO42S", "B0055CP9HW", "B000RPCJ9I", "B004KDYR20", "B004RPQSVE", "B0085A9IWS", "B000G0O5FA", "B005OT80W2", "B00BPEJWAE", "B001MEJYDW", "B00005JKEX", "B00D3DJH7S", "B00BFNJHCI", "B000E991S4", "B00508W2Z8", "B0002IQL8K", "B005VU9LO0", "B003J216K4", "B007Y1NPSM", "B000A2XC3A", "B00023P4V0", "B00317LM9W", "B0029W2V9U", "B00006II55", "B004X63SCY", "B0002V7O2Y", "B00347AIN0", "B000AM6OOY", "B008BJTZ62", "B000TGKWTO", "B007PA93YW", "B00EALTWRC", "B004TFTE86", "B0025KW29U", "B0006IIPIK", "B00005NC66"], "bought_together": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003IRUFCA", "B003IRUFBG", "B004N5UTUO", "B0000AGWK2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 52237}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 56.97, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B00020HAY2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GPM1GTTWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra (Special Edition)"}

{"description": "No more good news, everyone--this fourth volume ofFuturamais the show's last. By turns frenetic and far-sighted, Matt Groening's futuristic comedy provided belly-laughs for self-confessed sci-fi nerds, but somehow failed to connect with a broader audience, even though it was often funnier and sharper than stablemateThe Simpsons. So now bid farewell to the Planet Express team--Fry, Leela, Zoidberg, Bender, Amy, Hermes, Prof Farnsworth--as well as to kindly Kif, cloned Cubert, megalomaniac Mom, mutants in the sewer, the cast of robo-sitcomAll My Circuits, swashbuckling space lothario and William Shatner wannabe Zapp Brannigan, Elzar the four-armed chef, and all the other characters that madeFuturamasuch a unique experience.This fourth and final year has all the elements that fans enjoyed so much--but also those elements that partially explain its cancellation. Recurring characters are great if you've watched the show before, as are the in-jokes; and the many parodies of classic science fiction are fine for the initiated, but risk leaving other viewers out in the cold. The show's strengths and perceived weaknesses are exemplified in the episode \"Where No Fan Has Gone Before,\" in which the original cast ofStar Trekplay themselves: hilarious for Trekkers, but not really for anyone else. Elsewhere we find Leela discovering her real parents aren't aliens at all but in fact live in the sewers; Kif getting pregnant; Fry discovering the fossilized remains of his faithful pet dog; and Bender being converted to steam power. Despite some ups and downs, it's still the funniest animated TV show. Multifarious DVD extras include cast and crew commentaries, deleted scenes, animatics, galleries and Easter eggs.--Mark Walker", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008412UQ4", "B00008YGRS", "B008412UKA", "B004696M94", "B005QIOJUI", "B008AITJ7O", "B00158K0V0", "B000UZDO62", "B001DZOC78", "B001MT7ZI8", "B00F77MAO0", "B004696MAS", "B001DZOC46", "B001MT7ZII", "B005QIOJWQ", "B008AITJ7E", "B00F77MARM", "B00LFW6BA0", "B0007PAM10", "B003CN5B7E", "B000E6ES9O", "B000HT3P6U", "B0012KSUTA", "B007KFZ7PG", "B001RIZ7OI", "B0012018OE", "B003DZX46G", "B007KFZ8AA", "B0055P2ISM", "B003L77G7Y", "B00E0FW054", "B003L77G9W", "B000AQ68Z0", "B00K8HAJN8", "B000NNK4DM", "B007KFZ7YM", "B007KFZ7Q0", "B001VFM0ZG", "B007KFZ8B4", "B00BYNL8DU", "B001GQ3GHG", "B000RO6JZO", "B00008YGRV", "B0058YPMHO", "B007KFZ88M", "B007KFZ87S", "B00KXEMDRG", "B00F4NPBI4", "B0000CABL2", "B00L3PA8P8", "B00775R45A", "B0025KVKBQ", "B003SLEDL0", "B0053O8A32", "B00DEN5MOY", "B000067DNE", "B007KFZ7UQ", "B000083C6V", "B007KFZ8AK", "B0001ZWLVU", "B00023P49M", "B00KUS5YGC", "B0024FAR52", "B00CO8WWS4", "B000CNESM6", "B00BTRKMNI", "B00466HOR6", "B000RO6JZY", "B007KFZ85K", "B0040JHX0W", "B0001MZ7KA", "B001L1S1PS", "B005QIOJ3A", "B00BM2JVAA", "B0002XVQT4", "B0030Y11NS", "B000EHSVDC", "B00FR81Z40", "B000KLQUMQ", "B006W93ELK", "B0006Z2L2Y", "B009SQ9Q5M", "B003H4RBA8", "B008L0YMZA", "B000EMGIDC", "B00ITV5SRC", "B0019CLMW8", "B00023P49C", "B005S97V82", "B000EGDAFC", "B000M7XRC4", "B00HSVNV6O", "B001053074", "B00960EHQI", "B000GIXLWA", "B00HDU9UOW", "B000LE1798", "B00BTRK95Y", "B000CSTK42"], "bought_together": ["B008412UQ4", "B008412UKA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00F77MAO0", "B008AITJ7O", "B004696M94", "B005QIOJUI"]}, "price": 12.9, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91508}, "asin": "B0002B15J2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1KRDKZ2L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Futurama: Volume Four"}
{"description": "Based on the manga by Rumiko Takahashi, the creator ofRanma 1/2andUrusei Yatsura, theInu-YashaTV series (2000) blends elements of Japanese folklore and familiar anime devices into a deftly imaginative blend of humor and adventure, an extremely entertaining series that never falls into clich&#xE9;.  Beginning the first season's 27 episodes, Kagome Higurashi, a normal 15-year-old girl, falls down a dry well--and finds herself in the feudal past, 50 years after her ancestress Kikyo imprisoned the half-human/half-demon Inu-Yasha. As the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome possesses a magic jewel that greatly increases the power of demons. Kagome fetters Inu-Yasha with the help of her priestess-ancestor Kaede, and when the jewel is shattered Kagome and Inu-Yasha must ally to recapture the fragments.The series really begins to hit its stride when Kagome and Inu-Yasha, while bickering, nevertheless prove an effective team against the demons they encounter in the Warring States netherworld. Two new characters create complications. Shippo, an orphan fox spirit, meets Kagome and Inu-Yasha in the Warring States period. A more conventional but potentially more dangerous addition is Hojo, a handsome upper classman at Kagome's school, who's concerned about her recent absences. His understated good manners contrast sharply with the prickly Inu-Yasha--just as Kagome is beginning to recognize his good points.In the multi-part adventure that begins with \"Kikyo's Stolen Ashes,\" the filmmakers presenting conflicting versions of the relationship between Kikyo and Inu-Yasha, and the intriguing plot twists typify Takahashi's sophisticated story-telling. The tone darkens as the back story emerges: 50 years earlier, Kikyo tended Onigumo, a badly burned thief. As his desire for the Sacred Jewel--and Kikyo--grew, Onigumo summoned a horde of demons, whom he allowed to consume his flesh and soul. The evil creatures fused to form the terrible Naraku. Recognizing his feelings for Kagome, Inu-Yasha tries to protect her from Naraku by sending her back to her own time and blocking the passage between the ages. Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Shippo, and Miroku face a bizarre array of monsters and villains, including a forest demon who vomits hordes of monstrous, three-eyed wolves.As the tapestry grows richer, Kagome and Myoga begin to explore the origins and nature of the Sacred Jewel that radiates power yet brings misfortune to everyone who approaches it. The source of the jewel turns out to be the demon-slayers' village. Inu-Yasha, Kagome, and their friends learn how the Jewel was created long ago in a battle between hordes of monstrous demons and Midoriko, the greatest priestess of the age. But the Jewel is also a miniature battleground between good and evil: a metaphor for the world--and for Inu-Yasha's heart, as he vacillates between selfishness and kindness.

{"description": "As legendary as Sherlock Holmes and Watson, the brilliant, curmudgeonly Nero Wolfe and his dapper sidekick Archie Goodwin use their wit, inventiveness, and flair to solve the most perplexing crimes. His imperious \"seventh of a ton\" lodged firmly behind his desk, Nero Wolfe rarely leaves his Manhattan brownstone, preferring instead to spend a few hours a day attending to his beloved orchid collection or feasting on the sumptuous meals prepared by his Swiss chef. Archie Goodwin is his stalwart legman, a stylish, street-smart sleuth who uncovers the clues--as well as the bodies--that let Wolfe unravel the most confounding mysteries.

From childhood, Julien and Sophie engage in an obsessive battle of one-upmanship:  if one of them hands a brightly colored candy tin to the other and makes a dare, the recipient is bound to honor it, no matter how destructive or dangerous the dare might be. When this wacky habit enters adulthood and begins wrecking their lives, they ought to change... but that's not how l'amour fou works. PartAmelie-style comedy, part dark fable, this movie has quirkiness to burn, if not always as much charm as it thinks it has. Leads Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard are ardent, although somewhat out-acted by their juvenile counterparts in the film's early section.

Feast your eyes on his first feature, the madcap Glen or Glenda? in which Eddie himself portrays a transvestite struggling with his addiction to angora while Bela Lugosi offers inscrutable narration. Blackmail, outlaws on the run, and plastic surgery collide in the surreal crime drama Jail Bait, featuring a young Steve Reeves (Hercules), while Bela returns to create the Bride of the Monster in a heady collision of atomic experiments, a rampaging octopus and clumsy assistant Lobo (played by wrestler Tor Johnson). Wood's indisputable disasterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space, offers pie-plate flying saucers, incompetent alien leaders, all-seeing psychic Criswell, goth favorite Vampira and a post-mortem appearance by Lugosi himself in his last film role. Then Lobo and a phony spiritualist usher in a Night of the Ghouls at a spooky marsh filled with shuffling undead and wailing ghosts. Finally, learn all about the man himself with The Haunted World of Ed Wood, a comprehensive disc packed with interviews, film clips, TV rarities and much more! It's enough to make you scream!", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0000VD04M", "B008BSM1GO", "B004XC5LO6", "0922915245", "B0009X770E", "B00JV054CO", "B00005R1O7", "B00D9EJFZA", "6305760403", "B00D9EJFV4", "B006ZUMOX0", "B00004Y7GR", "B000FWHW8Q", "B00DOZNGC2", "B000WNHTCC", "B000UAFDR0", "B000G8NXP0", "B00I099JO6", "B000A59Q1O", "B000C20VNM", "B00465I1BK", "B0001HAGTM", "B0007R4T3A", "B00JGR3MIK", "B00JHH1VSW", "B000RPCJ9I", "B000RXVNDI", "6305772711", "6305869367", "B00EFYB03S", "B0081AWUVI", "B000VUQ4HW", "B000A0GOEQ", "B00023P4UQ", "B000063UR0", "B0024FAG3U", "B00018D3YQ", "B003CNQPO2", "B002TSAAS8", "B004KDYR20", "B0000694WH", "B004RPQSVE", "B001AD8G2K", "B003CNQPOC", "B002945DUW", "B007K7IBZM", "B00004Y87O", "B000PC6Z2A", "B000051S7L", "B001ECDVKE", "B0007R4SZY", "B000EHSVJG", "B00027JYMG", "6305772681", "B000286RP2", "B000EHSVJ6", "078323502X", "B006TTC5J0", "B000C65YHG", "B0036R92US", "B00000ILEU", "B00LC92BE6", "B00006JMQG", "B004RBC5U6", "B00317LM9W", "B00AYEUPAM", "B004RPQSNM", "B004X63SCY", "B000E991S4", "B0024FAG2G", "B00005K3OF", "B0013D8LAE", "B00FERT0PK", "B000035Z3K", "B0009X770O", "B00DTECHWS", "B007HCI4SE", "B0002RQ3M0", "B00005O071", "B00D3DJH7S", "B000H1RFG4", "6305999872", "B00009PY4I", "B000UDGOBG", "B000WMA6HS", "B00092ZL3A", "B000096I9V", "B00DQBPVCM", "B00FC1ZC9Q", "B005TMY00K", "B00GHH9IIA", "B00508W2Z8", "B005BUA1FS", "B000068TPF", "B000CFYAMC", "0767830555", "B000FFJZO2", "B002CWKU0Y", "B001J710Y8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["6305760403", "B0000VD04M", "B004XC5LO6", "B000LSBXIY"]}, "price": 9.98, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 26549}, "asin": "B0002W4TNA", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W8CR9BNRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Ed Wood Box (Glen or Glenda / Jail Bait / Bride of the Monster / Plan 9 from Outer Space / Night of the Ghouls / The Haunted World of Ed Wood)"}
{"description": "There's not one cougar to be found in24's dynamic third season, and that's good news for everyone. After Jack Bauer's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) survived hokey hazards inseason 2, she's now a full-time staffer at CTU, the L.A.-based intelligence beehive that's abuzz once again--three years after the events of \"Day Two\"--when a vengeful terrorist threatens to release a lethal virus that could wipe out much of the country's population. Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) attempts to broker a deal for the virus involving drug kingpin Ramon Salazar (Joaquim de Almeida), whose operation Jack successfully infiltrated at high personal cost: to maintain his cover, he got hooked on heroin. That potentially deadly triangle--drug lords, addiction, and bioterrorism on a massive scale--sets the 24-hour clock ticking in a tight, action-packed plot involving a potential traitor in CTU's midst; the return of TV's greatest villainesses in Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke) and former First Lady Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald); a troubled romance between Kim and Jack's new partner Chase (James Badge Dale); and a scandalized reelection campaign by president David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who monitors CTU as they struggle to (literally) save the day.The intricately woven subplots that are24's greatest strength are masterfully developed here, and character arcs are equally strong, especially among CTU staffers Tony (Carlos Bernard) and his wife Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth); CTU director Ryan Chappelle (Paul Schulze), who is season 3's tragic bargaining chip; and the annoying but well-intentioned Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), who makes pivotal contributions with by-the-book efficiency. It's24's superior casting that overcomes the series' occasional lapses in credibility, and season 3's twists make marathon viewing a nerve-wracking delight. By the time it's all over,24once again leaves you gratefully exhausted. As always, Sutherland anchors the series in the role he was born to play. When Jack takes a private moment to release 24 hours' worth of near-fatal tension and psychological anguish, Sutherland proves that24's dramatic priorities are as important as its thriller momentum. DVD extras include behind-the-scenes featurettes (about the prison break sequence, climactic F-18 Hornet air-strike, and real-life bio-weaponry) that pay welcome tribute to the series' hard-working crew, who create Emmy-worthy television under pressures as intense as24itself.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW", "B000NDEXK2", "B000MR8W92", "B001L5SRJE", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B0015QWZ8S", "B002ZCY7TG", "B00G4RCXPI", "0756632277", "B003PGNBO8", "B00AIBZMD6", "B003FSTN52", "B00J5LXT44", "B000YABIQ6", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00HEPE6MM", "B003L77GK6", "B00005JOC9", "B002N5N5QQ", "B0024FAR5M", "B00BC5I6Q2", "B00HT850YW", "B001F12J0C", "B00BFAIH68", "B00JJRLFVS", "B005PPMHO2", "B00HUCF420", "B0049P1VHS", "B00ECHBSP8", "B00H57HOSC", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00GTZWZH6", "B00IKM5LXG", "B00AB65RUG", "B0058YPG1G", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00E8OMZGG", "B00EIXWMII", "B008JFUNTG", "B0058YPL66", "B00JF5GAZA"], "bought_together": ["B00008YGRU", "B000B837XI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00008YGRU", "B000NDEXK2", "B000ICLRKC", "B000NDEXKW"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 4783}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 24.55, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B0002XVQSU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FD9X234WL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 3"}

{"description": "If you spliced Charles Addams, Dr. Seuss, Charles Dickens, Edward Gorey, and Roald Dahl into a Tim Burtonesque landscape, you'd surely come up with something likeLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Many critics (in mostly mixed reviews) wondered why Burton didn't direct this comically morbid adaptation of thefirst three booksin the popular series by Daniel Handler (a.k.a. \"Lemony Snicket,\" played here by Jude Law and seen only in silhouette) instead of TV andCasperveteran Brad Silberling, but there's still plenty to recommend the playfully bleak scenario, in which three resourceful orphans thwart their wicked, maliciously greedy relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who subjects them to... well, a series of unfortunate events. Along the way they encounter a herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly), an anxious aunt (Meryl Streep) who's afraid ofeverything, and a variety of fantastical hazards and mysterious clues, some of which remain unresolved. Given endless wonders of art direction, costume design, and cinematography, Silberling's direction is surprisingly uninspired (in other words, the books are better), but when you add a throwaway cameo by Dustin Hoffman, Law's amusing narration, and Carrey's over-the-top antics, the firstLemonymovie suggests a promising franchise in the making.--Jeff ShannonA Message from Count OlafDear Adoring Fan of Count Olaf,Perhaps once every thousand years, a talent emerges that completely changes the way movies are made, orphans are orphaned, and heartthrobs throb. Often this talent has only one eyebrow, as is the case with one of the most cherished and admired actors scheming today. Surely you can you guess of whom I think.No, you fool! I am referring to the One...the Only...the Unbelievably Handsome Count Olaf!Or, as I like to call him, Me.If you&#x92;ve already seen my performance in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you must still be speechless. But if you haven&#x92;t, you are in serious danger. Just teasing. But you could be after I send one of my gifted henchpersons to your home!So why not get my movie on DVD? This major motion spectacle has everything. Me, acting! Leeches, attacking! Orphans, almost falling off a cliff! Of course, if you are familiar with books by Lemony Snicket, you know that they include all of these things too, but most of what he says is lies, and the rest is completely boring.There's never been a film that demands repeated viewing in quite the same way, with a diabolical genius writing you a letter that says, \"I DEMAND REPEATED VIEWING!!!\" Plus with DVD extras, you&#x92;ll get at least 20% more Olaf for your money. And... just for you, for an unlimited time only, I&#x92;ll throw in Aunt Josephine free with purchase.*So, noble Amazonians, put down your hunting spears and exotic headdresses, and prepare to bask in True Greatness. Or, as I like to call it, Me.Of course you may have my autograph!Count Olaf*Count Olaf will not be held liable or accept blame in any way for any and all liability, loss, damage, or personal injury (including death), without limit and without regard once Aunt Josephine is thrown in, due to the unpredictable behavior of hungry leeches.Stills fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events(Click to Enlarge)Violet, Count Olaf, and KlausAunt JosephineCount Olaf and Aunt JosephineDirecting Jim CarreyKlaus, Mr. Poe, Sunny, and VioletCount OlafOlaf AscendingThe Baudelaire OrphansAll Things SnicketSee a complete list of allLemony Snicket's creations, including books from theSeries of Unfortunate Events, calendars, and more.The Essential Lemony Snicket BooksA Series of Unfortunate Events: The Ominous Omnibus, Books 1-3The Situation Worsens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 4-6The Dilemma Deepens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 7-9The Slippery Slope: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10The Grim Grotto: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 11A Library of Unfortunate Events, Books 1-10Behind the Scenes with Count Olaf: A Series of Unfortunate Events Movie BookLemony Snicket: The Unauthorized AutobiographyThe Puzzling PuzzlesActivity BookMore from the MovieOriginal Movie PosterSoundtrackWall PosterLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate EventsComputer & Video GamesFor PS2For PCFor XboxFor GameCube", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00AEBB8KQ", "B001NPD9JA", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067", "0061146331", "0061146315", "0061146307", "0064410161", "006055620X", "0060095563", "B0016Q2D5M", "B00009XUM5", "B0002W4UDE", "0064410153", "B00139W3NE", "0064408647", "0064407691", "0060586583", "B001LPWGBO", "0060839090", "0064410145", "B000Q66FB6", "B000G1R394", "B007R6DJP8", "006029809X", "B004M1A21K", "0060562250", "B000E8M0VA", "0064408655", "B0000VCZKW", "B00AEFZ6V4", "B00AEFY9RG", "B00AEBB8DI", "B000J10FLY", "0064410129", "B000GB5MH4", "B00AEFY8FO", "B001APZMJS", "0060566159", "B001HN694K", "0807219908", "B00H5NY7DQ", "B003HARV3Y", "B000C3L27U", "B0001I9YGW", "B004A8ZX3C", "0064408639", "B00005JPH2", "B00005JLOT", "B001DPHDCY", "0064408663", "B002ZG984Q", "B002ZG97F6", "0767836324", "B0000VCZKM", "B0000YTP02", "B005F96UJ6", "B000031EGV", "B00028HBES", "B003L20IJM", "B000M343BC", "B000ELJAEM", "B002WJI2QQ", "B002GHHHNS", "0783235070", "B004AKCME8", "B0000640SC", "B00081912E", "0807219916", "B000P0J09W", "B00IEXX4KS", "B0036TGSIK", "B00005JG6M", "0783225482", "B008QE9XD2", "B000QGDY0G", "B00AEFXJS6", "B000P0J0A6", "B00437IEI6", "6305123454", "B002JUFPX6", "B0006JMLRK", "B008JFUNTG", "B005LAIH4A", "B000AP04FG", "B0009NZ2KG", "B001QOGYAO", "B000BB1MI2", "B0014Z4OMU", "B000E6EHE0", "B002NZK5SW", "B00005JOWW", "0783219806"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0061146307", "B00AEBB8KQ", "B000OYCM5I", "0061119067"]}, "price": 13.47, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 48674}, "asin": "B0007PICAI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510HCJR3SCL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events (Full Screen Edition)"}

{"description": "Remington Steele's fusion of whodunit mystery and screwball comedy burst onto television in 1982. After struggling to get clients to hire a female detective, Laura Holt (sultry Stephanie Zimbalist) invents a fictional boss named Remington Steele, whose dashing manly name draws in work. But while protecting some South African jewels, Holt runs across a mysterious thief and con-man (an elfin, baby-faced Pierce Brosnan) whom her client assumes is the nonexistent Steele--and when the case is resolved, the accidental detective decides he likes the work and sticks around, infuriating Holt with his arrogant ways and tantalizing her with his dashing good looks. Murders may occur at a winery, an island sex club, or a college reunion, but just about every episode plunders plot elements from classic movies likeBringing Up Baby,The Third Man, andThe Trouble with Harry(even the theme song was written by film composer Henry Mancini). The writers openly acknowledge this influence by having Steele use ideas he's lifted from movies to solve crimes. The constant allusions to old films should be annoying, but the show demonstrates such a rich affection for the classics that these tips of the hat actually mesh withRemington Steele's world.Remington Steelehas become best known as Brosnan's launching pad (he later become James Bond inGoldenEyeand its sequels), but Zimbalist was every bit as crucial to the show's success; her mixture of glamor and toughness gives the show a distinctly adult sexiness and grounds Brosnan's boyish charm. The dialogue sometimes slipped from arch camp to sheer cheese, but even at its most ridiculous (say, a scene where Holt and Steele question homeless bums while dressed in formal evening wear)Remington Steeleremains an eminently watchable show, thanks to zippy plotting and the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan. Some episodes clearly implied that the pair had become intimate, yet that didn't defuse their attraction. Even when the stories became a bit silly, the mutual respect and desire between Holt and Steele never lost its sophistication.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000AQ68SC", "B000E6ESC6", "B000FKO3HG", "B0007XBMA2", "B000ASDFIG", "B00005JOJR", "B000GRU09I", "B003L77FWA", "B000SK5Z70", "B000CRR3NI", "B0069NPEV2", "B003L77FWU", "B000GW8UAE", "B009L0NC82", "B006CR2OWM", "0792844068", "B002WQ79A4", "B00005JMHI", "B000BGR1B4", "B0012E2F60", "B001JTRKHW", "B0009NZ30A", "B000LXGXY8", "B00HV0TJM2", "B00008YLV5", "B00005JO3P", "B007V4QLWE", "B00006G8FD", "B008X8U83K", "B0002I84N0", "B003GOOZGW", "B000BF0C8E", "B00DJYJQSQ", "B0013FZUP6", "B000YKYT1M", "B000N2HD6O", "B00005JNHS", "B005I0DV2G", "B000XJD3K2", "B004OB2EYQ", "B0007KZQAM", "B00008DDVT", "B004D45NXI", "B00005U8QM", "B000E5KQMI", "B000BUE5DC", "B0030Y12AK", "B000GEIRVY", "B00G4NV7B8", "B00113ALL8", "B000WP07F6", "B00IXXVCT4", "B0036TGSR6", "B00005JNHU", "B000HWZ4HU", "B00005JLEY", "B001E6JC1M", "B00005JNHT", "B000EQ5UIC", "B0007LXP86", "B001JFKWE4", "B000B5XSVM", "B00GHH9HW2", "B00317LM7Y", "B001675ZJW", "B005TTEG5W", "B000LXGXWK", "B0006IUDXA", "B000TZX5XK", "B0002COTDA", "B000RPCK1U", "B000Z6GT18", "B0012EM5EW", "B00ESK1PES", "B003QTDH8E", "B0028S110K", "B00ALTQRNO", "B000NOIX66", "B00096S46M", "B005HWAOH0", "B001J0FVYK", "B000NDEXO8", "B009RO9LKK", "B000VDDDZA", "B002LFQIL2", "B00E8AVN9U", "B000HXDWG4", "B00JDCP0QA", "1603993428", "B0030VANIU", "B000GPPNO2", "B000H1RFXM", "B007AAF3FK", "B000GNOSHW", "B000GW8UAO", "B000M9BPGC", "B001ACFQNS", "B00005JN8S", "B00096S480", "B003BGZ61S"], "bought_together": ["B000AQ68SC", "B000FKO3HG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000FKO3HG", "B000ASDFIG", "B000AQ68SC", "B00005JOJR"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28738}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 19.95, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B00096S45S", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5195PFG0SRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Remington Steele: Season 1"}

{"description": "Val Lewton's name is synonymous with the subtlest, most mysterious brand of horror filmmaking in Hollywood's golden age, and the nine horror classics he produced at RKO between 1942 and 1946 constitute the most remarkable cycle of creativity in B-movie history. (For the record, the Lewton/RKO legacy also includes two non-horror entries,Youth Runs WildandMademoiselle Fifi.)Before becoming a film producer, the Russian-born Lewton was a prolific writer of pulp fiction, nonfiction, and a couple of pornographic novels. He also worked for years as assistant to David O. Selznick, a legendary producer with a distinctive personal signature--and a flair for grandiosity Lewton himself never emulated.  It's ever so revealing that, on Selznick'sGone With the Wind, it was Lewton who came up with the idea for the famous rising shot of the Atlanta railyard filled with Southern wounded, with the Confederate flag streaming above--only he idly proposed it as a joke, never imagining that anyone would actuallyfilmsuch a spectacularly ambitious scene.In 1942 Lewton left Selznick to undertake a series of horror films for RKO Radio Pictures.  The studio would give him a budget around $200,000 per picture and a title RKO deemed to be grabby; Lewton would have a free hand as long as he stayed on budget, used the title, and gave the studio a salable movie of second-feature length (around 70 minutes).  Over time, Lewton would increasingly have trouble with studio supervisors, but RKO was the right place for him.  Although low in the pecking order among Hollywood majors, the studio made up for its lack of MGM-style glamour and Warner Bros. grit-and-gusto by working in a finely filigreed, almost miniaturist style.  The art department under Van Nest Polglase and Albert S. D'Agostino was capable of exquisite artisanry, and in Nicholas Musuraca, a master of low-key cinematography and supple camerawork, Lewton found an invaluable collaborator in creating moody shadow-worlds where what you couldn't see was more disquieting than what you could.He was also fortunate in having Jacques Tourneur to direct his first three efforts (they had teamed years earlier on the Bastille-storming sequence for Selznick'sA Tale of Two Cities).  They scored first time out of the gate with both a popular hit and a masterpiece:Cat People(1942).  The story involves a pretty young Serbian woman in Manhattan (Simone Simon) convinced that her ancestors had practiced animal worship during the Middle Ages--and that she herself might shape-change into a lithe, ravening panther if her passions were aroused.  The film is uncannily successful in keeping the viewer guessing whether this is a phobia borne of morbid obsession and sexual repression, or a genuine, horrific possibility.  There are two sequences of matchless artistry and almost unbearable suspense--a lonely, echoing walk through pools of lamplight alongside Central Park, and a late-night swim in a deserted indoor pool--that build to throat-grabbing climaxes and remain milestones in the history of screen horror.Many critics feel that the second Lewton-Tourneur endeavor,I Walked With a Zombie(1943), is both men's finest work.  The title is so lurid that the heroine-narrator (Frances Dee) must shrug it off with her very first words, yet the movie is an amazingly delicate and poetic piece of spellbinding--nothing less than a reworking ofJane Eyreon a voodoo island in the Caribbean. Other horror aficionados prefer the more mainline ferocity ofThe Leopard Man(1943), an adaptation of a Cornell Woolrich story about a serial killer strewing corpses along the U.S.-Mexican border.  Although on one level this is the Lewton film that veers closest to conventional mystery-suspense, there's no end of unsettling ambiguity (another black panther on the loose!) and hints of occultism and religious mania.RKO promoted Tourneur to A-movies after this; Lewton would never again have so masterly a directorial partner.  Yet in a weird sense (which is only appropriate), this underscores how much Lewton--with his wealth of arcane historical lore and storytelling archetypes, his quiet, patient attention to detail, and his taste for oblique narrative--was the essential auteur of all his films.  Promoting first Mark Robson and then Robert Wise from the editing table, Lewton went on to make the deeply mysteriousThe Seventh Victim(1943) andThe Ghost Ship(1943), two films in which such grotesque elements as Satan worship and murderous psychopathology are folded away inside eerily drifty, almost becalmed sleepwalks into eternal night.The Seventh Victim--a movie populated with more walking dead than Lewton's out-and-out zombie picture--is one of the cinema's supreme meditations on the ways lives brush against one another in the spaces of a great, impersonal city.  AndThe Ghost Ship(the rarest of Lewton's films, owing to a ruinous copyright suit) is like a fever dream from which the viewer never awakens.That's enough for a legacy, surely.  Yet there remainThe Curse of the Cat People(1944), a sequel that is not quite a sequel, a pretend-horror movie that's really a contemplation of the fragility of childhood;Isle of the Dead(1945), a doomed reverie about travelers who escape the Goya-esque chaos of a 19th-century war only to be beset with plague on a miasma-shrouded island;The Body Snatcher(1945), an atmospheric Robert Louis Stevenson adaptation that invokes the grisly history of graverobbers Burke and Hare, and supplies a together-again-for-the-last-time occasion for Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi; andBedlam(1946), the Hogarth painting come to life to portray the real-life horrors of an 18th-century insane asylum.Bedlam's critical and box-office failure ended Lewton's quasi-independent status at RKO; he would live to make only three other, unsuccessful films.James Agee, the premier American film critic of the 1940s, reckoned that Val Lewton was one of the three foremost creative figures in Hollywood--an assessment yet more impressive when we consider that the other two were Charles Chaplin and Walt Disney.  His greatest films--Cat People,I Walked with a Zombie,The Seventh Victim--are towering achievements, and even his half-realized projects are haunting experiences, the products of an utterly distinctive sensibility.  This is an extraordinary collection.--Richard T.

{"description": "Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable thatCrasheven got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing. A politically nervous district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his high-strung wife (Sandra Bullock, biting into a welcome change of pace fromMiss Congeniality) get car-jacked by an oddly sociological pair of young black men (Larenz Tate and Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges); a rich black T.V. director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) get pulled over by a white racist cop (Matt Dillon) and his reluctant partner (Ryan Phillipe); a detective (Don Cheadle) and his Latina partner and lover (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a white cop who shot a black cop--these are only three of the interlocking stories that reach up and down class lines. Writer/director Paul Haggis (who wrote the screenplay forMillion Dollar Baby) spins every character in unpredictable directions, refusing to let anyone sink into a stereotype. The cast--ranging from the famous names above to lesser-known but just as capable actors like Michael Pena (Buffalo Soldiers) and Loretta Devine (Woman Thou Art Loosed)--meets the strong script head-on, delivering galvanizing performances in short vignettes, brief glimpses that build with gut-wrenching force.

Both films change a lot of the original Cole Porter stage musical, but at least the later version keeps a few more Porter songs. Still, there is something odd about a Cole Porter film filled with \"additional songs\" by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen (perhaps Porter's work was not warm and cuddly enough for 1956 America, although it seemed to work well at MGM withHigh Society, released the same year). Crosby plays a Broadway star teamed up with young TV hotshot Donald O'Connor. Vacationing separately in Europe and needing a leading lady for their upcoming show, each signs a prospect--Crosby snaps up Mitzi Gaynor (at her perkiest) and O'Connor finds Jeanmaire, a French dancer. The show can only have one female star, so when the quartet crosses paths on the ocean liner back to the U.S., sparks will fly. Or not--this Paramount musical lacks any definable zip, from the sleepy dialogue to the listless camera. The capable Nick Castle staged the musical sequences, although Jeanmaire's numbers were choreographed by Roland Petit (also her husband). The Porter songs are half-heartedly rendered, although O'Connor and Gaynor get some oomph into \"It's De-Lovely.\" Der Bingle was born to burble \"Blow, Gabriel, Blow,\" but it's too little, too late.--Robert Horton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004H0M2X2", "B005DTCKTM", "B0001FR55C", "B000059GEI", "B004VWXUPA", "B004X63RS4", "B00143XE1E", "B00AATV0WS", "B00007J5VP", "B0015FGCI8", "B00KGLS050", "B0017IAIGU", "B0001WTWXS", "B00004W5VC", "B00IF0KAYS", "B0062Z0PA2", "B00005JNA9", "B000EBD9SK", "B001PO550A", "B006AC9H92", "B00008AOWI", "B000EBD9RG", "B00005JLIU", "B00143XDYC", "B00008DDRU", "B003NF97IU", "B00AATGDY8", "B0001DCYUK", "B00GXKZQIM", "B000EBD9S0", "B00008AOWK", "B0045HCJQM", "B0001LJCRA", "B0017I3S30", "B000EXDS7A", "B00143XE28", "B00067BBLY", "B000PAAK50", "B000PAAK5A", "0739078593", "B003XXCC8E", "B0041T50J2", "B00003CX8U", "B000H6SXSS", "B000HT3PGK", "B000ND91YU", "B00004VVMZ", "B0002B15RE", "B0089J270U", "B005F265IE", "B000F7CMPO", "B002SUS3IQ", "B00008AOWL", "B000EBD9SA", "B00023P4RO", "B0001FVDQE", "B000EXDSAC", "B00012FXJ0", "B008RO6PIM", "B00406UJZG", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B0050Z4CY0", "B00007J5VS", "B0007939NO", "B005NFJAZS", "B0013Z7RUC", "B000E0ODZY", "076781326X", "B0007QS2ZW", "B0007939MK", "B000QCUZE8", "B004G9C7RK", "B0039UU3JQ", "B00ECW9ZV2", "B000MGBLQO", "B00BY8DKJ0", "B0090XLDKY", "079284484X", "B0007939M0", "B00J2AU8MY", "B00006AUGF", "B005CCKEU2", "B000ND91Z4", "B0062Z0PGG", "B00178T3Q6", "B001O2UTRW", "B0017I79BW", "B000PC8AL4", "B004X63S1K", "B000O78KWE", "B001MBTSTA", "B000GETTIO", "B00JXVNVRG", "B009904NCS", "B009L4DSXM", "B00AB2NYSM", "B000HT3PGU", "B000F7CMQI", "B00347AIQW", "B00BY8DG1W"], "bought_together": ["B004H0M2X2", "B005DTCKTM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004H0M2X2", "B005DTCKTM", "B0001FR55C", "B004VWXUPA"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 41741}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 41.98, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000A6T1I6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JWYFNYYWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Anything Goes"}

{"description": "The playful 2004 television version ofOnce Upon a Mattressbrings everything full circle for Carol Burnett, who played klutzy Princess Winnifred, would-be fiancee of royal mama's boy Prince Dauntless, in theoriginal 1959 Broadway castproduction of the musical (as well as 1964 and 1972 television adaptations). In the new show, Burnett now essays the role of Dauntless's control-freak mom, Queen Aggravain, and is very funny in the part. An Oedipal nightmare, Aggravain is in no hurry to let the prince act his adult age, chasing off prospective wives (and queens-in-training) by putting them through unbeatable tests. Along comes Winnifred (Tracey Ullman, who manages the physically demanding role quite nicely), who turns the kingdom on its head with her goofy charm, sets Dauntless's heart aflame, and poses a serious threat to Aggravain's plans. The fun supporting cast in this tuneful take on \"The Princess and the Pea\" includes Tom Smothers as King Sextimus, the mute monarch who manages to impart wisdom, Zooey Deschanel as pregnant Lady Larken, who helps bring Winnifred to the castle, and Denis O'Hare (21 Grams) as the boyish Dauntless.--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000002ONH", "B000003G7Y", "B00001PE59", "B00005JLIU", "B00068NVG6", "B000VKL6RK", "B00BX8PG3Y", "B00004Z4SE", "0881881015", "0783240287", "B00004XMTJ", "B00004W5VC", "B000I2J6YG", "B008SBXFUU", "B0007WFXZI", "B0013Z7RUC", "630530209X", "B0000BWVMQ", "B0000C23HY", "B00005JL1P", "B001PO550A", "B00JHH1ZN8", "B005NFJAZS", "B000BITUNE", "B000O76ZR6", "B000059PQI", "B001LMAKAG", "B0000BZNDK", "B0060QSGJ0", "B00004RFEZ", "0767827929", "B00005JM6A", "076781326X", "B000RPCK2E", "B0000DZTOM", "B0000VCZKM", "0767827651", "B0090XLDKY", "B00070HK24", "B00005OCMS", "B002D0L0R2", "B002HK9IDQ", "B000093NR3", "B00AATV0WS", "B000HT3PGU", "B0014IC31G", "B003T05SV4", "B00IQH7R7I", "B000056KE9", "B000EWBKMG", "B000IOM0S8", "B001PO54V0", "B00IYRLUAU", "B0007939NO", "B0000AM6IY", "B005GZ2CWS", "B00007J5VN", "B007JNR3K6", "B003BZXIDW", "B0007939M0", "B002RWT1OA", "B000UAE7NG", "B000NTM9ZM", "B0000640T0", "B002JT69LE", "B002NZK5TG", "B0007Z0O9U", "B000002JC2", "B00F0JGA6E", "6303646689", "B00J2T18EW", "B0045HCJJY", "B003W2B8M2", "B000067D1R", "B00JAOW3MA", "B000H1RFPA", "B004I2K4DY", "B00007L4MV", "B006GHA9QQ", "B00GPWEPZ8", "B000HT3PGK", "B0045HCJ80", "B00079HZTS", "B007P7UF0G", "088145222X", "B007XTDWKQ", "0783226772", "B00IXD2N1K", "B000AYQOA6", "0822224453", "B004CLYJEQ", "B0007TKNII", "B000BT970O", "B00IBQ5M1W", "B000KJTC7S", "B00E4XR7TG", "B0033HKCX2", "0822214962", "B001MBTSTA"], "bought_together": ["B00001PE59"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BX8PG3Y", "B00068NVG6", "B00004Z4SE", "B00001PE59"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 17076}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 10.99, "brand": "Buena Vista Home Video", "asin": "B000ATQYVK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6175NMC2G6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Once Upon a Mattress"}
{"description": "Oh boy. Here we go again! Just another exciting day in the life of24super-agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). The season kicks off with a deadly terrorist strike resulting in the kidnapping of his new boss, the U.S. Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane). Although a fired, ex-employee of the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), it is no surprise who is going to shift into full gear to bring the terrorists to justice. However, it doesn't take the super-agent long to discover the kidnapping of his boss is part of a much larger plan, master-minded by Habib Marvan (Arnold Vosloh) the middle eastern terrorist cell leader the US government has been trying to track down for years. Considered by many to be the best season of the first four,24 - Season 4is a definite departure from the first three seasons. First, the cast is almost entirely new. Second, the pacing of each episode does not seem as frantic. There appears to be a shift from the reliance on plot-shifting cliff hangers (which in some ways dragged down the quality of Season 3), to a focus on complex, over-arcing, multiple storylines, albeit very violent. What may be missing in superficial action clich&#xE9;s is definitely compensated for in a richer plot. That's not to say the show has slowed down; it's still amped up beyond anything else on TV, but compared to the previous seasons,24has gotten a lot smarter, and in turn, better.--Rob Bracco", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92", "B00008YGRU", "B001L5SRJE", "B000NDEXK2", "B002ZCY7SW", "B001DMVZOE", "B002ZCY7TG", "B0015QWZ8S", "B00G4RCXPI", "B000KQF6ZI", "B0000DIJNU", "B000FKO3GW", "B00KPP6R9S", "0756632277", "B000RO6JY0", "B000JBXHZK", "B000F8DV1M", "B00KPP6ZLS", "B000G5SILC", "B00129W6LE", "B0015RRNMA", "B001HUWQEA", "1845764633", "B000NDEXKW", "B001JNNDJM", "B0018CWEYY", "B005TZFZ5Q", "B001934SNM", "B00E8OMZGG", "B000BNI90Y", "B001993YD6", "B002HRF68A", "B0060MYLCU", "B005FOH19Y", "B00BC5I6Q2", "0060842245", "B00EIXWMII", "B004ZBFRG2", "B00915G6NK", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B009LDD1H6", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IXPQU8U", "B00HT850YW", "B0024F08RO", "B0015TX2LO", "B000AJJNFE", "B0027VST2Q", "B004YM6IZ6", "B0053O8AKU", "B001RTSPVY", "B0044E9JU0", "B000W91RUG", "B002N5N5NE", "B000FIMG68", "B008K1PWMW", "B000P6YNSE", "B000GB75CO", "B0020TS5EM", "B000RO6JZ4", "B0019LY5IM", "B00HEPE6MM", "B000R9YLKY", "B00KS9V6EC", "B00J5LXT44", "B001A4VH2U", "B000HT3P60", "B000FVQLIO", "B00005JNOG", "B001DJLCRC", "B0036EH3XE", "B0032UYFA6", "B005QET8FS", "B000V86OKG", "B003R0MEZ4", "B00EEDNR9A", "B0058YPG1G", "B00BD6KXKW", "B0015ABRE2", "B00158K0R4", "B005FISBTO", "B0027CSMY0", "B007A2Z3Y4", "B00B5J6A7W", "B00EIXWW2O", "B00AIBZMM2", "B00J49R0ZQ", "B009MF5BXK", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00JA3RVG4", "B00HEPC0TS", "B001AI776G", "B0058YPILY", "B00FEVZH8K", "B00HUCF420", "B003L77G1K", "B009DS6YGO"], "bought_together": ["B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000NDEXKW", "B0002XVQSU", "B000ICLRKC", "B000MR8W92"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 7242}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 22.89, "brand": "20th Century Fox", "asin": "B000B837XI", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JD8J6VK0L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "24: Season 4"}

{"description": "Quiet patience and an observant eye turn a seemingly unpromising subject into a rich and fascinating movie.The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillcaptures the life of Mark Bittner, a gentle homeless musician who's befriended a flock of wild parrots in a neighborhood of San Francisco. Following Bittner, thecamera zooms in on individual parrots, revealing their individual personalities and the traits of their species. This leads to Bittner's own life, the network of friendships that support him, and the ways in which the parrots--a non-native species--interact with both the natural ecosystem and the city government; just about every topic opens up another until a flock of colorful birds represents a microcosm of nature and society.Filmmaker Judy Irving has created an exemplary documentary simply by paying attention to the details of the world around her subject.Everything you expect from a Hollywood blockbuster--romance, violence, humor, sorrow, strong personalities in conflict--is here in spades, except that the heroes and heroines have bright red and green feathers. Utterly rewarding.--Bret FetzerProduct Description:An \"engrossing, delightful film\" (The Washington Post),The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillis the bonafide sleeper theatrical hit of the year. The film's endearing guide is Mark Bittner, an aging bohemian, but the supporting cast members, a rambunctious flock of urban parrots, are the true stars, and their surprisingly humanlike behavior makes for a wondrous and rare experience. The film follows the ups-and-downs of these wild birds within the green niches of San Francisco as Bittner befriends, feeds, and names the members of the flock. Along the way, we meet many unforgettable characters: among them Connor, the grouchy yet lovable outcast of the flock, crying for a mate but luckless in his pursuits, and \"the lovers,\" Picasso and Sophie, inseparable until Sophie is forced into mourning when Picasso disappears. More than a mere birdwatcher, Bittner finds solace in his immersion with these strikingly beautiful creatures - but how will he cope when he's evicted from his sanctuary and forced to live away from the parrots? Packed with romance, comedy and a surprise ending that \"makes you feel like you could fly out of the theater\" (San Jose Mercury News),The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hillshows just how wondrously similar the human and animal worlds really can be.Wild About Animals? See More!The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill(book)March of the PenguinsGrizzly ManWinged MigrationBest Documentaries of 2005Nature & Wildlife DVDsBelow, Cinephile Ned Viall interviews producer/director Judy Irving:Ned: There's a scene early on where you ask, \"Why don't you cut your hair?\" Mark says, \"I'm not going to cut my hair until I have a girlfriend.\" So I wondered, \"Will there be a scene at the end where he cuts his hair?\" Did you know what was going to happen when you recorded that scene?Judy: I recorded that close to the beginning of the project. I didn't know how things would end up. As I was editing, I knew what I was doing, though. Like in dramatic films, I wanted to have setups and payoffs throughout the movie. That was one of them. I also wanted folks almost to forget it after it happened.Ned: I was struck by the narrative quality of Parrots. It&rsquo;s almost like a fiction film. There&rsquo;s Connor, the outcast. He's like the tough guy who turns out to have a heart of gold, sticking up for the injured birds as their fellow cherry heads attack them. Then he suffers his apparent tragic demise&mdash;like the brother in Slumdog Millionaire.Judy: Connor was the classic outsider. I didn&rsquo;t make anything up. The cherry heads didn't like him because of his blue head. Discrimination happens even in the bird world.Ned: Another part of the story arc was where you create this beautiful world, and then it has to end. Mark has to leave. What's going to happen to the birds?Judy: That all happened while I was filming. Mark was living in the cottage, and the owners had to ask him to move because it was literally sliding down the hill. I knew that might happen when I started filming. I just hoped I&rsquo;d get enough shot before he had to go. So his moving became part of the story. But in a documentary you can't control those things. There's no script. That's the risk you take. You just hope events will unfold in a way that makes a good story. I much prefer storyline documentaries to standard &ldquo;talking heads and b-roll&rdquo; type documentariesNed: In the movie you&rsquo;re not antagonistic exactly, but you keep asking Mark questions like, how come you don't get a job? Gradually, that changes. There&rsquo;s more to him than you thought.Judy: When I first met Mark, I wasn't sure he was movie material, frankly. (Laughs.) After awhile I realized he was a great storyteller, with a good voice and screen presence. I needed to ask the questions that the audience would ask.Ned: The film is not at all what most people expect it to be.Judy: Right. And because of the title, a lot of guys aren&rsquo;t interested in watching it. Then their girlfriends or wives drag them to it, and they&rsquo;re moved. They find out that it's about much more than just parrots. It's about personality, consciousness, and life and death.Ned: And love.Judy: (Laughs.) And love.", "related": {"also_bought": ["140008170X", "B0000CBXZU", "B001CQS7LU", "B000BI5KUQ", "0783231210", "B007C8RZWO", "B005OAEWV4", "B000069HXL", "0609610554", "B001BBAVKQ", "B004CRR9FG", "0061673986", "B00F1BFSI2", "0375760253", "B000ADS6DA", "B00075E24S", "B008WAM2PG", "B00AMQGV14", "B000CDSS18", "0793805627", "B00443FMIY", "B000KC829Y", "B00005LK94", "B004ISVGXU", "0691142858", "0967882001", "B005E7SEMU", "B009VRVGLK", "B000R7I4A4", "B0002JL9N6", "0764119184", "073946485X", "B002KLALEC", "B00CIHI9PG", "B0037X5BME", "B0010Q74AM", "B001QXC4BI", "0764583530", "B004MYOWYU", "0764119206", "B004K4FUNO", "B0040J1RZO", "0764127837", "B005Z2D87K", "B0002DJVAA", "0876669593", "1937786021", "B0006FFRB6", "B000F0UUSM", "B00008PHD1", "B004NNVETQ", "6305572194", "B00094AS6I", "0792168313", "0876059035", "B003JLL2RW", "B005TZFYWU", "B00AEFYO08", "0764136674", "B000MZGN4K", "B00081U66O", "B004LWZWBU", "B000TEXPDG", "B004CJQVQC", "B00D6I7EGQ", "0486233375", "B000I5Y8FU", "B000EBD9RQ", "B00000IQBE"], "bought_together": ["140008170X", "0783231210"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0783231210", "B001CQS7LU", "140008170X", "B000BI5KUQ"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 25132}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 15.34, "brand": "PBS", "asin": "B000BB1534", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SZCK625NL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"}

{"description": "Gunsmoke: 50th Anniversary Edition Volume 1is a winning collection of episodes from the long-running CBS Western's first nine seasons, with an accent on special guest stars who had yet to find fame. A few key storylines are in the mix, too, includingGunsmoke's first episode, dated September 10, 1955 and introduced by John Wayne, who more or less suggests that the series' beefy star, James Arness, is cut from the same heroic cloth as the Duke himself. No matter who drops in for a guest spot, however, or whetherGunsmokewas a half-hour or hour-long program (the show doubled its running time by season 8), the running storyline and core characters are as constant as the prairie stars.Arness plays plain-speaking U.S. Marshal Matt Dillon, who keeps the peace over a wide territory from his perch in Dodge City, Kansas, a rough-and-tumble town where prospectors, farmers, bounty hunters, outlaws, and the occasional lunatic pass through. Dennis Weaver lends support as Dillon's deputy, Chester, a courageous clown; Amanda Blake is saloon keeper Kitty; and Milburn Stone plays irascible Doc, apparently Dodge City's only physician.Volume 1highlights feature a couple of episodes with Charles Bronson, including \"The Killer,\" in which the futureDeath Wishstar portrays a psychopath preying on the weak. Mogul Aaron Spelling, at one time a character actor, appears as a spacey wanderer who nearly gets lynched in \"The Guitar.\" Cloris Leachman is very good as a woman with a diabolical edge in \"Legal Revenge,\" Angie Dickinson is memorable as an Arapaho Indian whose marriage to a white settler incites racial anger, and Jack Lord portrays a pair of brothers who threaten Doc's life. Burt Reynolds, who joined the cast ofGunsmokeas the half-white, half-Comanche character Quint, is introduced in the very effective drama \"Quint Asper Comes Home,\" while Ken Curtis, whose goofy Festus effectively replaced the departing Chester in season 9, enters the series in \"Prairie Wolfer.\"--Tom Keogh", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITUZC", "B000H7JCHI", "B0001NBND4", "B000PHX5KU", "B00CL151P0", "B0046S8MRU", "B00CL151ZU", "B005PTYPK2", "B005D7E7PY", "B0083TUEDS", "B001E6JC1W", "B00BAXTYGW", "B00BAXTY9O", "B003XEKXYI", "B008OIQZ36", "B00KB01OG8", "B0013LRKVM", "B009DA74DY", "B001TWT0CW", "B000W8OM68", "B00A6SZRT0", "B00KB01N4G", "B000EOR0BY", "B000F9T70K", "B0002W4TVM", "B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B001NRPQK8", "B000EQ46H8", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B00BXTDVEO", "B000VS6R3A", "B0044RFTDI", "B0001JXPXY", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B004HHX9T6", "B000QQA5VC", "0786475889", "B001RHGRPW", "B00BR0SECI", "B005D7E7Y0", "B000TQZBNQ", "B006VRRGOO", "B002DH20PQ", "B003NF97MQ", "B009RNK0YC", "B009CZTFUK", "B000K7VHOQ", "B0057IY55Q", "B00008CMRL", "B000NY1EAI", "B00H8KC1N4", "B0080QOLEW", "B001NVV7G6", "B00E96AY20", "B00CD45JDE", "B00GJT22VQ", "B00AEFXFW6", "B007V4ETS2", "B000NOIX7U", "B003VKVTL0", "B00E8RVSZC", "B006W95BWA", "B000A0GXGA", "B0001JXQ2Y", "B004PQM81E", "B00007G78A", "B006ZL1P84", "B009ERK2UI", "B007RUZ29A", "B001BN4WHW", "B001JAHPMG", "B0018PH3L0", "B00962R0H4", "B0064CT90U", "B0055SJWDI", "B00BLN4V2I", "B0049GYXBS", "B000BITUYI", "B0001JXQ2O", "B0018QAIY8", "B002OLT6UI", "B00BDZV8TI", "B0008FXSSI", "B000N3T0GE", "B00A2XQTFK", "B000NOK0JE", "B00A73ANHA", "B005LVIP1E", "B00BDZV4PQ", "B000N6UF10", "B000ANVPP6", "B000EQ46HI", "B007V973KI", "B005TFVM0I", "0783228031", "B007JVM69Q", "B002E58FT2"], "bought_together": ["B000BITUZC", "B000H7JCHI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000PHX5KU", "B000BITUZC", "B000BITUYI", "B000H7JCHI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 122745}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 23.53, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000BITUZ2", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5134EV9QBRL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection, Volume 1"}

{"description": "The first half ofBattlestar Galactica's second season left no doubts about the continuing excellence of the best science fiction TV series of 2005. Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama's son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin's mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1. As all of these plot threads are expertly interwoven, the high-stakes conflict ofBG 2.0culminates in a suspenseful mid-season cliffhanger. Through all of this,Battlestar Galacticamaintains consistently high standards of intelligent drama and well-justified, story-based use of spectacular special effects, while developing rich relationships across a broad spectrum of interesting supporting characters. The series' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore's \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show's writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it's undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series. With solid ratings, good scripts, and a devoted cast and crew,Battlestar Galacticashowed every indication of thriving toward a third season and beyond.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE", "B000AJJNFE", "B002HRF68A", "B000V5IP6K", "B002ZCY872", "B00A3717C0", "B00466H3A4", "B00064AFBE", "B001RTCP1U", "B002JE43O4", "B000W4KT9G", "B003RR991Y", "B00GX7D5G0", "B002HRF7AW", "B003H9LIYS", "B00A3718IS", "B0000AFX64", "B00C7MW5SE", "B00344EAFK", "B001B7CNZ6", "B000QDLSR0", "B000UZ4C4A", "B000F8O2OM", "B000F8O2OW", "B00IWTVDUW", "B000F8O2P6", "1417078723", "B005PPMHWE", "B0024FAD9C", "B00005JNOG", "B00242KD1S", "B0032JTUX4", "B002BAW6GS", "B002N5N5MK", "B000BW7QWW", "B00BD6K54G", "B0007TKH66", "B003H9LIRK", "B0017MO10U", "B002BAW6GI", "B000A9QKRI", "B000FCUYKO", "6303961614", "B004EXWGHY", "B00F6WXPSQ", "B003L77GWE", "B000F8O2Q0", "B0009Q0F5U", "B003L77GUG", "B004HYW84G", "B000LC4ZI0", "B000B8IA2G", "B007USE5CE", "B0002PYS7Y", "B002BWP2IK", "B001RHGRTS", "B0000AQS0F", "B002BAW6FE", "B000F8O2PG", "B00243FQFA", "B000HEZEY6", "B000FIMG68", "B00E3QJ7JC", "B000F8O2PQ", "B000B837XI", "B005PPMHO2", "B00GTZWZH6", "B000RBA6CO", "B0009JE6G6", "B0048FUUAI", "B0028ERCMU", "B0081QF6Q8", "B003BNO9GO", "B000GLKNRI", "B004X60QWO", "B00062IDCO", "B0030VANJO", "B002BAW6FY", "B007XF0XVQ", "B00F3L8P26", "B000FP2OPY", "B001D2WUGG", "B00402FGE4", "B0057FGD3Q", "B0000CABIJ", "B003BV8I7C", "B002VA59ZS", "B000SO7PBU", "B00E8OMZGG", "B002VA5A02", "B00188XHFI", "B001DMVZOE", "B008R52LA2", "B002PXJRR2", "B004X60QE2", "B004TJ1H3C", "B000CEXFYW", "B0002WZTCA"], "bought_together": ["B001HUWQEA", "B00129W6LE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0036EH3UC", "B000AJJNFE", "B00129W6LE", "B00A3717C0"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29107}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 14.69, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000BNI90Y", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IfCLLm3jL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)"}

{"description": "\"Girls are brutal,\" a father warns his young son in the course ofOdd Girl Out. \"They&#x85; tear each other to bits over the smallest things.\" Director Tom McLoughlin's 2005 film proves it, too, offering up a harrowing tale of one teenager's horrendous treatment at the hands of her high school classmates. When we meet Vanessa (Alexa Vega, also seen inSpy Kids), she's a reluctant member of a group of spoiled, snooty girls who rule the school hallways like designer-dressed harpies. But when she betrays \"best friend\" and clique leader Stacey (Malcolm in the Middle's Leah Pipes), it all starts to go south; little matter that said betrayal is actually concocted by the genuinely vicious Nikki (Elizabeth Rice). What begins as a relatively petty campaign of text messages, rumor-mongering, and daily ostracism soon escalates into full-scale torment and cruelty, including a particularly nasty website, an invitation to a party that doesn't exist (the better to humiliate the eager and insecure Vanessa), and her near-tragic reaction to these events. McLoughlin's resume includes TV shows based onA Nightmare on Elm StreetandFriday the 13th, so it's no surprise that this film has a stylized, horror film vibe; there is nothing remotely light-hearted about this story (loosely based on Rachel Simmons' non-fiction bookOdd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture Of Aggression In Girls), which focuses not only on Vanessa's nightmare but on the well-meaning but futile efforts of her mother (Lisa Vidal) to help. But having stoked the viewer to expect Stacey, Nikki, and their co-conspirators to get the comeuppance they so richly deserve, the director delivers a largely unsatisfying denoument. Too bad, because up until then,Odd Girl Outis a real eye-opener, and a frighteningly accurate account of the living hell that is high school life.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00652U72S", "B00366BBNU", "B000A7Q2I2", "B004MCGNRQ", "B000FDEVBQ", "B00366BBTE", "B005YFGJFG", "B0006Q94AK", "B00A4TMLKE", "B000784WYA", "0156027348", "B00BDZV8ZM", "B002GHHHEC", "B004ZG17G6", "B0047HXMIY", "B000CS45H4", "B000ASATTY", "B0031RAOY6", "B000NJMJHK", "B000679MF6", "B000IMVORS", "B00KFNF17E", "1602861846", "B00013RC2K", "B000A59PZG", "B000062Y1E", "B000YQRAGM", "B000E8NRC6", "B000ETR9VU", "B0001DCBUS", "B00E6F148M", "B0009WFF7W", "B000A59PZQ", "B00000FZC1", "B000WWQI0W", "B000BKDNVM", "B000KP62FM", "B000EPFCXQ", "B008NBH09W", "B004TH78GE", "B007VI5AQ8", "B0042FDCO0", "B009P3J5VS", "B004O8OLO0", "B000803BQ2", "B0007US7C6", "B0001ZDLTG", "B00005NKT3", "B000HRMDJW", "B00005NKT2", "B007QXJ3S4", "B00005V9HY", "B000BB1MQO", "B0000714DV", "B005GKCDHM", "B0000JCFMW", "B001H1I8KK", "B003EYVXZ0", "B0077PHKJK", "B00366BBTO", "B00151QYC6", "B00IYRLUAU", "B00AEFYMBO", "B003E697ME", "B000083C6I", "B000O785X8", "0156028158", "B000JLQQ94", "B000A6T1U4", "B000H5TH0M", "B000MNOXX0", "B0001Z3HWC", "B0013MOLPY", "B001D7T460", "B00180OU84", "B003IG06PM", "B003TVTRKG", "B0009JKVSS", "B0055SJXSC", "B000QUCNSQ", "B0001WTV7U", "B000GFPCMU", "B002GIBVQ6", "B000EWBNQO", "B003JLL2PY", "B00005V9I9", "B000ION23A", "B000FUTVVO", "B004MCGNTE", "B0015VQAZM", "B000F6IOAM", "B000EQ5V5Y", "B00GSTHC7G", "B00CAYH23M", "B0007NXS36", "B000MEYJHE", "B00006HAWN", "B003JLL2RW", "B00062IVN0", "B00722SRBS"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00652U72S", "B004MCGNRQ", "B000A7Q2I2", "B00366BBNU"]}, "price": 8.96, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 90572}, "asin": "B000BYA5GY", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512CZK7HYGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Odd Girl Out"}

{"description": "Andrew Davies isn't much of household name in the U.S., but he's the king of the BBC mini-series. His skillfully adapted scripts forPride & Prejudice(the beloved Colin Firth version) and many, many more are peerless examples of classic novels done right--cunningly edited and shaped to let all the rich emotion and sharp intelligence spill over with zip and vigor.Bleak Houseis no exception; it's one of the best Dickens adaptations to date. The mini-series form allows Dickens' panoramic view, brimming with eccentric characters and complex turns of plot, to sprawl out without losing an iota of suspense or momentum. Two innocent young  orphans (Patrick Kennedy and Carey Mulligan) are the potential heirs to a fortune, but their fates are snarled in a monumental legal battle known as Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But the heart of the story is another orphan, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin), whose mysterious parentage proves to be intertwined with the fate of the Jarndyce wards and the aloof Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson,The X-Files). Dickens' story twines through an excoriating vision of the legal system to heartbreaking domestic drama to a murder investigation to near-Gothic horror, all broken into utterly delicious half-hour segments (after the hour-long opening episode). Martin is utterly beguiling, homely at one moment and luminous the next; Anderson's grippingly eerie and brittle performance will delight her fans. But to single out anyone seems absurd, because every character--from the vicious lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance,White Mischief) to the foppish parasite Skimpole (Nathaniel Parker,The Inspector Lynley Mysteries) to the simpering clerk Guppy (Burn Gorman)--is intricately drawn, all hitting a mesmerizing balance between caricature and stark emotional honesty.Bleak Housedemonstrates that humor, pathos, and social criticism can all be contained in one wonderfully entertaining package.--Bret Fetzer", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001PU8N0I", "B0009PVZM8", "B002XTBECY", "B0009PVZIW", "B0031RAP5O", "B000M2E32M", "B000784WNQ", "B0077PBPGO", "B000GIXLUC", "B0009PVZL4", "B000FQIRXQ", "B00005YUNK", "B000AYEL6U", "B00065GVIO", "B0012OVCE6", "B00065GX96", "B00005JOA0", "B000EBD9VC", "B0077PBPVE", "B00140PK6O", "B0000AQS3P", "B004JMSIQS", "B001PU8O5W", "0141439726", "B000Z27HLS", "B00BCXW106", "B003WEAW18", "B00003CXSA", "B00F1BFRA6", "B00009MEJ4", "B00E3UN44W", "B000E0ODZE", "B004XVMCMQ", "B000FQIRY0", "B00003JRCQ", "B004K4FUUC", "B004QOB8SO", "B0083HXKMC", "B005T0OY5S", "B004132HZS", "B00H4ZEFTQ", "B002XTBE6K", "B007A2O3FO", "B000BNTMKK", "B00E3UN66I", "B001PU8MZO", "B000V1OUPE", "B000Z27HMW", "B00062IZ0Y", "B00141188M", "B00DW5IKN4", "B000LPQ6DE", "B00HUAGZ34", "B00BOTCJXC", "B009NRQTGU", "B0031RAP5Y", "0141439963", "B00BIR2A3E", "B003TY2STA", "B00C888LOO", "B0074FUSFG", "B002EWD0I6", "B0093I913W", "B000A8AXXG", "B000089QEM", "B002XTBEDI", "B000FQIRYA", "B000M2E32C", "B0013NAMLK", "B00AATGDUC", "B00B62R9XM", "B00HGE90Z4", "B00G6HO368", "B001GJ4U5A", "B009L2EW5W", "B0080QOL10", "B00J3M54AW", "B00AF82WTO", "B00IKM5OTW", "B000NJL4QC", "B002VWOMZ4", "B003CP1T50", "B00B83OIVA", "B00JJRLFVS", "B00CDZBS7O", "B000E8JNQU", "B001VLBDB2", "B001PU8O4I", "B00DW5ILF6", "B004N66XYE", "B0009PVZK0", "B00FRQ0L2O", "B001H9JBW6", "B00CLB7CFM", "B008UQUS26", "B00GAXASK8", "B00005JKNF", "B004JMSIVI", "B004H0ZHD4", "B00D49YFAA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0031RAP5Y", "B0009PVZIW", "B001PU8N0I", "B0031RAP5O"]}, "price": 1.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 141194}, "asin": "B000CEXG0U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515XGD7NEZL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Bleak House"}

{"description": "Based on Anthony Swofford&#x92;s excellentmemoirabout his experiences as a Marine Sniper in Gulf War I,Jarheadis a war movie in which the waiting is a far greater factor upon the characters than the war itself, and the build up to combat is more drama than what combat is depicted. To some viewers hoping for typical movie action, this will seem like a cruel joke. But it&#x92;s not. It&#x92;s just the story as it was written, and if you liked the book, you will probably like the movie. If you didn&#x92;t, then the movie won&#x92;t change your mind.The movie follows the trajectory of Swofford (played with thoughtful intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal) from wayward Marine recruit (he joined because he \"got lost on the way to college\") to skilled Marine sniper, and on into the desert in preparation for the attack on Iraq. No-nonsense, Marine-for-life Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), the man who recruited Swofford and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) into the sniper team, leads them in training, and in waiting where their lives are dominated by endless tension, pointless exercises in absurdity (like playing football in the scorching heat of the desert in their gas masks so it will look better for the media&#x92;s TV cameras), more training, and constant anticipation of the moment to come when they&#x92;ll finally get to kill. When the war does come, it moves too fast for Swofford&#x92;s sniper team, and the one chance they get at a kill--to do the one thing they&#x92;ve trained so hard and waited so long for--eludes them, leaving them to wonder what was the point of all they had endured.As directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), the movie remains very loyal to the language and vision of the book, but it doesn&#x92;t entirely work as the film needs something more than a literal translation to bring out its full potential. Mendes&#x92;s stark and, at times, apocalyptic visuals add a lot and strike the right tone: wide shots of inky-black oil raining down on the vast, empty desert from flaming oil wells contrasted with close-ups of crude-soaked faces struggling through the mire vividly bring to life the meaning of the tagline \"welcome to the suck.\" But much of the second half of the movie will probably leave some viewers feeling disappointed in the cinematic experience, while others might appreciate its microcosmic depiction of modern chaos and aimlessness.Jarheadis one of those examples where the book is better than the movie, but not for lack of trying.--Dan Vancini", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00JRB01RK", "B00275EGWY", "B001FB55L2", "B000065U1N", "B00JRB00RG", "B000P0J09C", "B00JU949TK", "079284646X", "B002ZG97RE", "B0015D20FE", "B00HLTD3ZW", "B00001ZWUS", "B005LAIGYQ", "B00AEBBA36", "B00JA3RVG4", "B002O3Z4Z2", "B008220CQU", "B00HEPE6MM", "B00102F5WK", "B003ASLJOU", "B000095WW8", "B00AZNEW5G", "B00HOGBXS6", "B00005YUPD", "B004XQO90O", "B000Y7WGOW", "B00AIBZMD6", "B00IKM5OCO", "B00JBGSHSQ", "B00005JOFQ", "B0036RPM8Y", "B00AEBB89W", "0743244915", "B003ELKNH2", "B00JL6L4UY", "B004L3AR0K", "B00A34LX2M", "B00005PJ8T", "B004SUDQ22", "B00I4X8KXY", "B00J11U54K", "B00005JK8K", "B00J0IN6Z4", "B0034G4P30", "B00IARA8KM", "B0000AC8LR", "B000M4RG42", "B00HW3LAF2", "B00DL48BM6", "B004LGGXG4", "B0000ACOXL", "B00AEFXVCU", "B0000542CK", "B00005JLOB", "B00006JU8B", "B0000797IO", "B00JPFTS2M", "B00005U8QN", "B005LAIGRS", "B00AEBB86U", "B00HEPC0TS", "B00KDK64DY", "B00JH4SZWK", "B00IO03I6Q", "B00HWWUR02", "B001MZ5W3M", "B000KGGIZK", "B000DZ7YN8", "B00005JMXX", "B00AEBB86A", "B0007KIFGE", "B00IKM5MIA", "1558908315", "B005LAIGLE", "B001N44BVQ", "B00IJS2OHM", "B00005R87B", "B00J5JSV3A", "B00HX0KIAM", "B00ICWO144", "B00GV8B17Q", "B00JQF7ZR6", "B003UESJHO", "B00005JL5F", "B00GMV8JVI", "B00IKM5NJS", "B00AEFY0F2", "B00KNALRZ4", "B00JU94ZPS", "B00E8AVNAE", "B00HVXK15S", "B00004XPPG", "B0034G4P94", "B009POCG0Y", "B008MIL46Q", "B009AMAJPA", "B001AQO3WY", "B00HGJAPYO", "B00ALCBTWU", "B008JFUNKU"], "bought_together": ["B00275EGWY", "B000065U1N"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00275EGWY", "B00JU949TK", "B000065U1N", "B000P0J09C"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 15490}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.75, "brand": "VISIT MORE @ HIBISCUS EXPRESS, http://www.amazon.com/shops/AXD9LOVGJXES3", "asin": "B000DZIGDU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2RVVCH9L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)"}
{"description": "The latest entry in theHarry Pottersaga could be retitledFast Times at Hogwarts, where finding a date to the winter ball is nearly as terrifying as worrying about Lord Voldemort's return. Thus, the young wizards' entry into puberty (and discovery of the opposite sex) opens up a rich mining field to balance out the dark content in the fourth movie (and the stories are only going to get darker). Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) handily takes the directing reins and eases his young cast through awkward growth spurts into true young actors. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, more sure of himself) has his first girl crush on fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and has his first big fight with best bud Ron (Rupert Grint). Meanwhile, Ron's underlying romantic tension with Hermione (Emma Watson) comes to a head over the winter ball, and when she makes one of those girl-into-woman Cinderella entrances, the boys' reactions indicate they've all crossed a threshold.But don't worry, there's plenty of wizardry and action inGoblet of Fire. When the deadly Triwizard Tournament is hosted by Hogwarts, Harry finds his name mysteriously submitted (and chosen) to compete against wizards from two neighboring academies, as well as another Hogwarts student. The competition scenes are magnificently shot, with much-improved CGI effects (particularly the underwater challenge). And the climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, in a brilliant bit of casting) is the most thrilling yet.Goblet, the first installment to get a PG-13 rating, contains some violence as well as disturbing images for kids and some barely shrouded references at sexual awakening (Harry's bath scene in particular). The 2 1/2-hour film, lean considering it came from a 734-page book, trims out subplots about house-elves (they're not missed) and gives little screen time to the standard crew of the otherPotterfilms, but adds in more of Britain's finest actors to the cast, such as Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Michael Gambon, in his second round as Professor Dumbledore, still hasn't brought audiences around to his interpretation of the role he took over after Richard Harris died, but it's a small smudge in an otherwise spotless adaptation.--Ellen A.

{"description": "SOUNDTRACK (AUDIO): RUSSIAN DOLBY DIGITAL 2.0 / ENGLISH SUBTITLES. \n\nSYNOPSIS: Vladimir Bortko has become the first Russian film director to start shooting of renowned Bulgakov's novel and not to stop half-way. All the others Russian directors once engaged in the production of \"Master and Margaret\" have actually turned out to be unable to finalize their projects. The rumors say, it is due to some mysticism... The \"Master and Margaret\" begins with two story lines: the Devil and his retinue show up to make mischief in 1930's Moscow while Matthew the Evangelist attempts to uncover the truth about Pontius Pilate and the Crucifixion of Jesus in Jerusalem in A. D. 33. Halfway through the novel, Bulgakov unveils a third story line set in Moscow, in which the love-stricken Margarita bargains with the Devil to be reunited with her lover, the Master, a tormented writer-hero who pines away in an insane asylum. Bulgakov gradually weaves the three scenarios together, all the while exercising devilish lampoonery and wit to satirize Soviet life under Stalin. Because public discussions of religion and critiques of the government had long been punishable by a trip to the gulag, the themes addressed in \"Master and Margaret\" very rarely surfaced in the Soviet Union: many Soviet citizens read the Gospel story for the first time in Bulgakov's narrative.", "related": {"also_bought": ["0679760806", "0141180145", "B0080VBRS0", "0810112124", "B002LC8LEC", "B00019G4TQ", "B000LV6OHQ", "0802150594", "B000K2UEDG", "B002PRYL9C", "B0002FHR0Y", "B0000714AW", "B003OXGW5M", "B003VWR1XI", "B0002KQOH6", "0802130119", "B00280QNK6", "0679410465", "B004AYM95G", "B00006LPEK", "B0000714AX", "B0000633SD", "B001QOZYRS", "B0000YEDM2", "5489003219", "B00008ZZ9M", "B00006JO77", "1590172019", "6305257450", "B00078GLT4", "B0080T44FA", "B000LTTOOS", "B00006IUJ1", "0486262448", "B000QGE86K", "B0080SFX38", "B0012ZO33W", "B006DJNPCC", "B00ID8HATK", "0879514620", "B00008H2I2", "B00005O06N", "B004Y2SDX6", "B00006LPEH", "1590170865", "B00B2BYXYA", "B000087F0N", "B00009MEKP", "0300151454", "0140455140", "0307472329", "B007TG6EHG", "B006ML50YC", "B001PCNZEU", "B0000YEDJA", "B00009NHAT", "0810112000", "1590175867", "B00H47IVO4", "160259192X", "6305327068", "1847493033", "B000I8OOG0", "B000YB6EA0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0679760806", "B00280QNK6", "0802130119", "B000E5RKOA"]}, "price": 7.91, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 91179}, "asin": "B000EANSXM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SxsCwJa6L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Master and Margarita / Master i Margarita (3 DVD SET, ENGLISH SUBTITLES)"}

{"description": "A popular and well-regarded comedy that ran for eight seasons in the '90s,Wingswas created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the team that worked together onCheersand later createdFrasier.  Tim Daly and Steven Weber play two brothers, Joe and Brian Hackett, respectively, who parted ways many years ago when a woman left Joe to marry Brian.  Joe, the straitlaced do-everything-right brother, is running Sandpiper Air, a small airline on the island of Nantucket that runs commuter flights to the New England coast, when he reluctantly offers a job to Brian, the carefree brother who's also a pilot. Others who work at the airport are Helen (Crystal Bernard), the former girl-next-door who now works the lunch counter and aspires to be a professional cello player; Lowell (Thomas Haden Church), the not-all-there mechanic; Roy (David Schramm), the owner of the rival airline AeroMass; and Fay, who handles Sandpiper's front desk. Over the short (six episodes) first season, Joe and Brian develop romantic triangles over both Helen and Brian's ex-wife, Carol (Kim Johston Ulrich), and Brian tries to set up Joe with the island tramp (Megan Mullaly).  In the second season, the romantic entanglements continue, Joe develops a health problem that keeps him from flying, and we meet the last major member of the cast, Italian cab driver Antonio Scarpacci (Tony Shalhoub). Guest stars includeCheers' George Wendt and John Ratzenberger, Abraham Benrubi (ER) as Roy's son, and David Ogden Stiers as a conductor whom Helen tries to impress.  While much of the regular cast faded from view afterWings, Shalhoub and Church garnered critical acclaim for their work onMonkandSideways, respectively.--David Horiuchi", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7ONI", "B00IFK7OFG", "B00IFK7O5G", "B000GTLB6C", "B001QU9RSE", "B000F8O2MO", "B000MX7V5C", "B00GOC74I4", "B001MVYUSO", "B000NTMA1U", "B000Z27H8Q", "B004ES6TBS", "B000YKYT1M", "B00HNGC56G", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0001Z3I0S", "B0025KVNOU", "B00LT1JHLW", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B00JDCP0QA", "B00KHA9BQ2", "B0006N2EZK", "B000A7Q1YC", "B000EOTVAM", "B000ERVJMM", "B000MGBLFK", "B001IXXYCE", "B001HUHBAY", "B0012EM5DS", "B000BF0C8E", "B0006IUDYY", "B000BGR1B4", "B006OKOWUY", "B004MWLXTY", "B000A0GOQ4", "B001D2WUDE", "B000LXGXY8", "B000N2HD6O", "B0001NBNIY", "B0007Y08JW", "B00KYCA4QY", "B0019F02W6", "B001P9N9B2", "B000MXPE6U", "B0002NY8R6", "B002OOWL3E", "B000QFCDAO", "B002PQ7JR4", "B00HRUQB5O", "B0025KVTLW", "B00K8HALVI", "B004WO9OMA", "B001JFKWE4", "B00JHH1VUU", "B00BUWD7NE", "B000B5XOTS", "B002OOWL3Y", "B005M5OS6K", "B000FTC1GW", "B00005JLIB", "B0000E32X2", "B0030U1TCK", "B00K8HAKSW", "B00DXLO0D6", "B0002W4SWW", "B00E96AWY0", "B005ZVIMUE", "B000RGULLA", "B002AMVEEM", "B006VC3LDO", "B00GLT2SOA", "B000EXDRZI", "B00008NV4G", "B000XJD3K2", "B0012EM5EC", "B000MGBSH6", "B00BM2JVAA", "B00EYA6VF0", "B000R7I3YG", "B008L0YMWS", "B00DXLO086", "B00I4581F4", "B001TKJDNA", "B0058EE6OO", "B0025VKX04", "B000ERVJMW", "B00IJZW35I", "B00GOC74RU", "B00GC2KI2U", "B00DD56724", "B00GOC75YW", "B0058EE6NK", "B001O4KBO6", "B00LU5PB0I", "B00I458456", "B001HUHBD6", "B0058EE6O4"], "bought_together": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7ONI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GOC74QG", "B00IFK7OFG", "B00IFK7O5G", "B00IFK7ONI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 87387}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 13.5, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000ELIZZM", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5114FZGNQWL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Wings - The Complete First and Second Seasons"}

{"description": "BeforeDegrassi Junior HighandSeventh Heaven, there wasThe Facts of Life--a feel-good sitcom where a lesson was learned at the end of each episode. Set in an all-girl boarding school, the series spanned nine seasons, countless hairdos, and an array of cast members and guest stars--some of whom (George Clooney, Helen Hunt, Molly Ringwald) would become very, very famous in the future. But in the 29 episodes that cover the first two seasons, the series introduces TV viewers to characters that represent girls everyone knows--Blair, the rich, spoiled girl; Natalie, the chubby smart aleck; Jo, the rebellious tomboy; and Tootie, the rollerskating tattletale.A spin-off ofDiff'rent Strokes,The Facts of Lifewas designed as a showcase for Charlotte Rae, who played jack-of-all-trades den mother Edna Garrett. But the show's central plots all revolved around the girls. Back in 1979, certain words weren't common on television. So when Blair tries to make a schoolmate feel bad, insinuating that the girl is a lesbian, she uses the word \"strange\" instead of the \"L\" word. The series is a coming-of-age story that plays to its target audience of teenage girls. While much of the humor isn't very sophisticated, the homespun messages the show spread are right on target, whether it's dealing with eating disorders, sexual promiscuity, or acknowledging that handicapped people are people, too. From 1979 to 1988, the girls would grow into young women who go to college, get jobs, and lose their virginity (not necessarily in that order). But in the early seasons, there's a sweet innocence that still rings true today.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000HIVIOC", "B001993YB8", "B003XL6EI0", "B0002JZT5U", "B000OVLBH6", "B000CELOW2", "B000C6NPHC", "B0001Z3I1C", "B000CELOVI", "B000CCBCCQ", "B007RMQ4HW", "B000K7UBXE", "B0000DFZ5O", "B000VWQU88", "B00008EYBH", "B004GJYR82", "B00465I1D8", "B008VIMLRI", "B00005JNIS", "B00005JO4F", "B000SQFC0O", "B000EU1QC2", "B001LRL4WY", "B00GOC75YW", "B00020X83Y", "B00IJZW35I", "B001GP5TMW", "B001NPK5BU", "B0089BSLKS", "B00008R9MC", "B00CVB6XDO", "B007JNZYPM", "B00I099K4U", "B0000ZMH92", "B00005JO2V", "B000068V9X", "B000291Q3Y", "B000291Q3O", "B00151QYT4", "B003L2YUR8", "B00K31RC0W", "B0006N2F0E", "B0002O7Y8U", "B0009X7BEG", "B000DZ95IU", "B0001O3YHQ", "B0066E6SSC", "B0002Y4T7O", "B000FA57U8", "B000B8IA3U", "B0006Z2L4W", "B0000AKY3Q", "B000NJMJHA", "B000MGBSEY", "B00005JOQZ", "B000Z6GT18", "B002JH2EHO", "B000OVLBGW", "B000FJAAHY", "B0009X7BEQ", "B00BUWD7NE", "B004NJC0IO", "B0002RQ3MU", "B0007WFXL2", "B0007WQHFS", "B00DXLO0BI", "B002ACKBTG", "B000H1RFXM", "B00D2UMHB0", "B000M343AS", "B000EGDAO8", "B000Y7U9AK", "B00007KK5I", "B001CQONNG", "B0066E6THW", "B005XLFB32", "B00008WJEZ", "B0007ZSHR6", "B000Q6GUJS", "B0002I837M", "B000BB1MIW", "B0007OCG74", "B000JMKKMM", "B00DXLO086", "B00DJYK1XU", "B000B5XOUM", "B000B5IP2O", "B00GOC74Z2", "B001DSNELU", "B00I458456", "B000M343AI", "B00JDCP0QA", "B000R7I3YG", "B0038Q9Q94", "B0016MJ73W", "B000E1MXVO", "B00EC9UI0C", "B0050MB5AC", "B0007V6IWQ", "B00DXLO0D6"], "bought_together": ["B000HIVIOC", "B001993YB8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00I099K4U", "B00GOC75YW", "B001993YB8", "B007JNZYPM"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 29025}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 9.24, "brand": "Columbia Tri Star", "asin": "B000EQ45BU", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BXVAQY94L._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Facts of Life - The Complete First &amp; Second Seasons"}
{"description": "Take a glance at the credits and you'll see that director James Goldstone's 1971 comedyThe Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straightis the work of some mighty impressive names. Screenwriter Waldo Salt had already won an Oscar forMidnight Cowboy, and would go on to writeComing HomeandSerpico. Jimmy Breslin, upon whose book the movie is based, was a celebrated New York newspaper columnist. The cast includes a young Robert DeNiro, Jerry Orbach (decades before being unforgettably cast as Det. Lennie Briscoe inLaw & Order), film veteran Lionel Stander, the very appealing Leigh Taylor-Young, and even Herve Villechaize (yes, Tattoo fromFantasy Island, except here his every line of dialogue has been dubbed by someone without an accent). Unfortunately, the film is decidedly less than the sum of its parts. The cast acquits itself adequately, notwithstanding some heavy-handed stereotypes (Jo Van Fleet, as the Orbach character's knife-happy mama, wears out her welcome early in the first reel). But Goldstone's background was mostly in television, and he handles the film with a heavy hand more suited to a bad sit-com. The story, such as it is, concerns the efforts of the hapless Kid Sally Palumbo (Orbach) and his dumb cronies to usurp mob boss Baccala's (Stander) power. Sally and his gang are inept--it's they, not Baccala, who keep getting knocked off--but not as lame as the movie, which relies on obvious gags, poorly-timed physical shtick, and an unconvincing romance between DeNiro's Italian bike racer-con man and Taylor-Young's Angela (as Sally's sister, although she's about as Italian as Mary Tyler Moore). Some of the bits are amusing, especially those featuring a lion (don't ask) in Sally's charge, but by and large,The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straightis a dull disappointment. The DVD includes no bonus material.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006SSQSY", "B0009HMTKI", "B00062IVJ4", "B00DW5IKW0", "B000286RP2", "B0000WN0SC", "0316111740", "B00006RCNV", "B00508W3KW", "B00IGK6TGU", "B00003CXJA", "B000RETOGU", "B006A8XGPC", "B002AO7QBA", "B00008DP4C", "B0001US62I", "B00FRILRL6", "B001T21R46", "B000ADS61C", "B000A9QK5K", "B001CQONHM", "B00AEFYT1W", "B007NQSQT6", "B00FEP9PQG", "B00AEFXRG0", "B000ERVK3K", "B00DZFKNFO", "B0018AQ2RG", "B000FTCLQW", "B000NQRR34", "B00DGCIZD8", "B00AEFY5GQ", "6305310335", "B00AEFYIDG", "B004YCKK46", "B007PM218K", "B0009GX1CO", "B007VXT9SS", "6305162034", "B00441GYRO", "B00I3C1T34", "B00003CXB5", "B0000EYUCK", "B00BTYJYOY", "B004I1JQWK", "0670333964", "0792839730", "B004SIP7TE", "0783225903", "B00BTYRB58", "B00066FB52", "B000O78L0U", "B0045HCIZE", "B0017TYPIG", "B009D004X6", "B001ECDVKE", "B000034DDG"], "bought_together": ["B0006SSQSY", "B0009HMTKI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["0316111740", "B0009HMTKI"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 98701}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 8.99, "brand": "Warner Home Video", "asin": "B000ERVK3U", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vlxyJmAXL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight"}

{"description": "The Stephen King Collection, a box set of four films,Graveyard Shift, The Dead Zone, Silver Bullet, andPet Sematary, is great in that it provides viewers with a full range of King movies, from the truly eerie to the terrible. The set's two finest movies,The Dead Zone, directed by David Cronenberg and starring Christopher Walken, andPet Sematary--arguably King's finest story adapted to film--both come as Special Collector's Editions, with excellent bonus material, including lengthy interviews with both Stephen King and the directors.Pet Sematary, shot in King's home territory, Maine, tells the story of city slickers Rachel and Louis Creed (Denise Crosby, Dale Midkiff), who move to the country to raise their daughter, Ellen, in peace. They learn that they've relocated onto a trucking thoroughfare, and Ellen consequently loses her pet cat. The plot quickly riffs out into mystical, traumatic territory. Louis's neighbor Jud Crandall takes Louis to ancient Indian burial grounds, where the dead are reanimated. The Creeds's zombie cat sparks this Frankenstein-ian adventure, pitting urban settings against rural, and the horrific against the pastoral.Pet Sematarylooks more and more like Hitchcock, thanks to director Mary Lambert's careful attention to detail. The low point in the set isGraveyard Shift, a washed-up story about a cotton factory that's not only infested by carnivorous rats, but also hosts a dragon/pterodactyl. As night-shift employees get continuously munched, Bachman Mills' owner Mr. Warwick is forced to clean up squalid conditions, for which he hires a basement clean-up crew. Crew members are slaughtered as they try to combat their discovered behemoth, and grizzly scenes showing rats, humans, and the beast's head being chewed up in the cotton gin reduceGraveyard Shiftto schlock gore. One is reminded of the intricacies involved in adapting books to film. As King has managed to be an integral part of his film projects, there are still successes and failures. All the movies in this set, though, still bear King's trademark, a love for \"supernatural deadfall.\"--Trinie Dalton", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00009OWI3", "B000U1ZV6W", "B008QE9Z8A", "B000GYI340", "B000H4JH7Q", "B00000F3SB", "B000G1R39E", "B000RZIGUE", "B0002O7XW2", "B0001FVDQ4", "B00005UQ9V", "B006J8NPAE", "B0010X73ZG", "B000053UIF", "B00A1AU72A", "B00BW4S8AC", "B000063US5", "1573625779", "B0000C2IQQ", "B000068IES", "6305645574", "B00AEFYV9W", "B00006FDCD", "0792841328", "B00C2CDJ34", "0790742829", "B00005O439", "B00BW4S87U", "B0007NFMB2", "B000069I05", "B00KDU8HQQ", "0767821599", "B00IYJRIKO", "B00AEBB91E", "B002VWNIDG", "B0053TWVDC", "B00030AZCK", "B000TJ6PBK", "B00BTYPW7C", "B00887496S", "B00005LQ0Q", "B00005JOJE", "B000Q66Q56", "0792846443", "B001DJLD1W", "B0002A2VK0", "0767817664", "630523650X", "B001DJLD0S", "B00006FDCU", "B0089N4G50", "1476770387", "B00009PY4G", "B000FJH5M2", "B005CFBZ8O", "B0007WFXNA", "B002U4UZSQ", "B00A429Y56", "B00DII0MGI", "B00BW4S89S", "B00CERJI5U", "B00AEFXR8I", "B000FFJZO2", "B0053TWV46", "0782011055", "B00KW3A6KE", "B00005K3NR", "B004EI2NP4", "B00009PY4C", "B0033HKCV4", "B000063UR5", "B002XD0J80", "B001ARDBWQ", "B00008K76W", "B0002OXVG4", "B00386EZUY", "0743235150", "B000U1ZV62", "B0002JP572", "B0085Z3AMW", "B00005U8Q7", "B001AR0D4A", "B000A88EU0", "B00070FX5U", "B002GHHHG0", "B002NZK5SM", "B002WDR4AC", "B004LLIRTU", "6305258287", "B00803PG44", "B002I41KNC", "B0085Z3ADQ", "B000P0J0EM", "0783237413", "B005CFC0N8", "B00AMDA2O4", "B004P7CMOQ", "B0002V7OI8", "B000E5N6B6"], "bought_together": ["B00009OWI3", "B000U1ZV6W"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BW4S8AC", "B00AEBB91E", "B008QE9Z8A", "B00006FDCD"]}, "price": 29.99, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 72131}, "asin": "B000GBEWS4", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517C8VGA1JL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Stephen King Collection ( Pet Sematary Special Collector's Edition / The Dead Zone Special Collector's Edition / Graveyard Shift / Silver Bullet) (1989/1983/1990/1985)"}

{"description": "On the surface,Changing Timesis a love story about a couple that is reunited after decades apart. But unlike many films so desperate for a happy ending that the characters' development are sacrificed to reach such a goal, this picture concentrates on the bittersweet reality of who they are today. Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu reunite (for the first time since 1988'sStrange Place for an Encounter) to portray Cecile, a radio hostess living in Morocco, and Antoine, an engineer who finds a project in Tangier in the hopes that he can find her and win her back. Their lives are now more complicated than when they first met. She is married to a Moroccan doctor who is unfaithful to her. And Antoine doesn't seem able to relinquish the memories of the Cecile he fell in love with, regardless of the fact that the woman standing before him today may actually be more compelling. The expressive actors take their time, revealing as much with their faces as their words. Directed and co-written by Andre Techine,Changing Timeshas a languid, exotic, and authentic feel. The one flaw is the inclusion of another subplot--that of Cecile's adult, bisexual son who hopes to rekindle a relationship with the love of his life--an ex-boyfriend.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00007K6J7", "B00007J5VT", "B004ZBFRRG", "B005J7K9AA", "B0036VH972", "B004XZ99UU", "B009B8YZ4Y", "B0016MLILG", "B0009K7RAC", "B000J4OYNG", "B00015YV4K", "B0000YEEN0", "B00007JZYI", "B0007KTAZE", "B0002KQNKE", "B00003CXF4", "B0008KLVC8", "B002M36R28", "B00G92TYDW", "B007I1Q59E", "B000SIWHB4", "B00005JPX8", "B0026MP1AO", "B0001BMLUA", "B000059H7D", "1572522135", "B004CZZZ0Y", "B000065AZC", "B0026MP1B8", "B0001WTWJ2", "B000JJSJ6O", "B008XAT1A4", "B002BEXE2E", "B000065AZA", "B000Q7ZL4M", "B000B5XOWK", "B000088UZ4"], "bought_together": ["B0006TPDWK", "B004ZBFRRG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002BEXE2E", "B00007K6J7", "B005J7K9AA", "B000065AZA"]}, "price": 16.86, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 226669}, "asin": "B000GNOH6O", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SEMQKZ3YL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Changing Times"}

{"description": "When Sheriff Berger (Robert Englund) executes serial killer Chambers (James Binkley) in the electric chair, it seems like it&#x92;s the end for the world&#x92;s most violent criminal &#x96; but it&#x92;s only the beginning.  Chambers escapes from the hospital morgue and proceeds on a bloodthirsty rampage through the locked down hospital. Fighting alongside Sheriff Berger are young hospital patients Sara Wexler (Meredith Henderson), and Walter (Nathan Stephenson). The two youths struggle to stay alive in a hospital rapidly filling with blood, along with the help of Nurse Grafton (Laura De Carteret).

{"description": "AfterWelcome to SarajevoandIn This World,The Road to Guant&#xE1;namois Michael Winterbottom's most important film. Along withUnited 93, it's one of the most important films released byanyonein 2006. In the docudrama, which was produced for British television, Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross recount the travails of the Tipton Three, a trio of Britons detained for two years at Guant&#xE1;namo Bay. How did these apolitical Muslims end up as suspected terrorists? The directors attempt to answer that question by inter-cutting interviews and news footage with recreations of their Kafka-esque journey. It starts with a trip to Pakistan for the wedding of Asif (Afran Usman). In short order, he's joined by Ruhel (Farhad Harun), Shafiq (Riz Ahmed), and Monir (Waqar Siddiqui). On a whim, they decide to visit Afghanistan: \"One, for experience, and two, to help.\" It proves to be their undoing. First, they're caught in a bombing raid; then the Northern Alliance rounds them up as members of al-Qaeda. In the m&#xEA;l&#xE9;e, Monir goes missing. The remaining three are shipped to Cuba, where US officials stop at nothing to coerce confessions. There&#x92;s a hard-won happy ending, but it isn't easy to watch--Alan Parker's Ollie Stone-pennedMidnight Expressseems downright lyrical in comparison. Further, the acting is inconsistent and the character development is sketchy. Those flaws aside,The Road to Guant&#xE1;namois powerful and provocative stuff.--Kathleen C.

{"description": "Director Spike Lee'sWhen the Levees Brokeis the definitive document of the unmitigated disaster that was, and is, Hurricane Katrina. It's also a contemporary manifestation of an ancient tradition: an oral history, told by the people who lived it, with no narration and only the occasional use of archival cable and broadcast news footage in addition to Lee's own film. And a grim tale it is, an \"American tragedy\" subtitled \"a Requiem in Four Acts,\" each of them about an hour long (\"Act V,\" appearing on the third of the set's three discs, is a lengthy epilogue with new material not included in the original HBO broadcast) and focusing almost exclusively on New Orleans, as opposed to the Gulf Coast region in general.Act I sets the scene; as the hurricane nears the Crescent City, some residents leave town, while others stay behind, figuring they'll just ride the storm out (Mayor Ray Nagin's \"mandatory evacuation\" order rings fairly hollow, as there's no public transportation provided for the many who don't own vehicles and thus couldn't get out even if they wanted to). The real problems begin after Katrina makes landfall on August 29, 2005. Displaced New Orleaneans crowd into the Superdome, soon to become a living hell for those stuck there; the incredibly poorly engineered levees break, flooding some 80 percent of the city; and people start dying by the hundreds, victims of drowning, lack of food, water, and medicine, and other causes. And so it goes. Act II finds the survivors struggling to keep it together while the federal, state, and local assistance they've been promised fails to show up; Act III traces the dispersal of these so-called \"refugees\" (as one man puts it, \"Refugees? You mean they took away our citizenship, too?\") all over the country, not knowing where their families, friends, and neighbors are, or even if they're still alive; and Act IV deals with the slow rebuilding of the city while insurance companies refuse to pay claims and money keeps going toward the Iraq war effort instead.Several themes predominate here. One, of course, is the appalling performance of authorities on nearly every level, who ignored specific warnings about the levees and then professed ignorance after the fact; Lee doesn't have to go out of his way to make George W. Bush, FEMA chief Michael Brown, and other members of the Bush administration (not to mention his own mother) look bad, as they do an excellent job of that themselves. Another is the shameful ineptitude of the response; it's hard not to be disgusted when it's pointed out more than once that while we were able to provide supplies and assistance to Indonesians within two days of the 2004 tsunami, American citizens were virtually ignored for five days or more. Most of all,When the Levees Broke(which includes optional commentary by Lee for all four acts) leaves us feeling the sheer rage of the poor and dispossessed of New Orleans, where the population is 70 percent African-American. Confronted with the ignorance, arrogance, and callousness of the people whose job it was to protect them, they can point to just one cause: racism.--Sam Graham", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004JA99XG", "B0027EU2S2", "B000053V7G", "B000BKDNYO", "B001DAVU50", "B000C3L270", "1416552987", "0415954878", "B004UXVFIO", "B002AMUDK8", "B000E40QC4", "0061148490", "B000O78632", "B000OCY654", "0671240676", "B00FRKKVL6", "0812976509", "B005FSEQBG", "B000VZBCUQ", "B009GPH46S", "B009LDD3RO", "0061131504", "046501772X", "B004AR4VRW", "0226443221", "1933405139", "B00005A1TJ", "B001LLH8SO", "B000051YMP", "0385523203", "B0031WNYHK", "B00FNPQW2W", "0143036491", "B000051YMS", "B000XJD34S", "B003BV8I3Q", "B00008K7AO", "B00FRL3SIS", "B00L5Y8GJC", "B008220AGC", "B00005JLRZ", "B00002RAO2", "B000KHYN9C", "B001BEK8FQ", "B0041U7RHE", "B000E0OBCO", "B008NNY8SQ", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B006JN86VW", "0531266265", "B00AZMFG48", "630514415X", "B00AEFY17E", "B000P0J0CE", "B00D9EJFS2", "B0000D9BBJ", "B000RIWATO", "B00005JKE4", "B00EJU9GQ6", "B00CEJVNEM", "B000CCD1TS", "B000YGE18C", "B002T4GY50", "0307718964", "B000EOTEM2", "B000G1R394", "B00315I6DE", "1596701846", "B00G4Q3NDA", "0674081153", "B0058KGHX6", "B0024EWP6W", "037571488X", "B00005JMCN", "B00E1LQEFE", "B00008DDVV", "0805086501", "B009LDD3WY", "B003X3BYJM", "0465017614", "1400065526", "B00GA9F2PI", "1608197514", "B000UNYJXQ", "B0000DZ3G2", "0807155055", "B000EOTEIQ", "B00013F2OA", "B0000560W6", "0061124834", "B000GE1VL2", "0143112139", "1452109699", "B00009AV7P", "B00772M1WE", "1560254947", "B000Q7ZOLC", "B009WJ6Y3C", "B0030Y11XS"], "bought_together": ["B004JA99XG", "B000053V7G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004JA99XG", "B001DAVU50", "B002AMUDK8", "1416552987"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 61456}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 16.99, "brand": "HBO", "asin": "B000J10F14", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BWVH0KCNL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts"}

{"description": "A disturbing film about a recovering drug addict trying to regain control of her life,Sherrybabysuccinctly depicts what can happen when want and desire aren't offset by control. In this bleak indie film, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal,Stranger Than Fiction,Secretary) has just been released from a three-year stint in prison. Dressed in her inappropriate uniform of a halter top and oh-so-high platform heels, she goes to brother's house to see her 5-year-old daughter, Lexie (Ryan Simpkins). Sherry is determined to be a mother to her child, but without a home, job, or any other form of stability, she grows frustrated and jealous of her brother and sister-in-law's roles in Lexie's life. Tall and willowy, Gyllenhaal brings a sad desperation and simmering sexuality to the role. Sherry's middle-class childhood was a blur of sex and drugs, and she seems incapable of breaking out of that destructive trap. While the script by first-time feature film director Laurie Collyer isn't wholly original, the picture moves at a good pace, giving insight as to why Sherry's resigned to using sex to get what she wants. While the family secret doesn't come as a complete surprise, it is somewhat perplexing that no one addresses it. Ultimately, it's Gyllenhaal who makes you care about a character that most people would've given up on.--Jae-Ha Kim", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000I0QL7I", "B0007CEXYK", "B000E6ESU8", "B00008MTXI", "B0006IIKRG", "B000LAZDPG", "6305692572", "B00004UEDQ", "B00A2H9QN8", "B000ERVK4Y", "B003YKYX9M", "B00005JM23", "B0045HCJ08", "B003Y5H59C", "B00005Q4CS", "B000Z3N1HQ", "6305162026", "B0017X1WGK", "6305594333", "B001E95ZNS", "B007VI5AQ8", "B00JAGF9HE", "B0052ADP6Y", "B0000549B1", "B000BBOUUE", "B003AC98V2", "B00009Y3QI", "B00EUENWIY", "B00049QQHI", "B002UNMWTC", "B004V4RW8O", "B000GB5M3S", "B000J10F8C", "B00005JH9M", "0578045427", "0792838068", "B0039Y774Q", "B0000ZMGWK", "B000XSKDBA", "B0015VQAZM", "B007TSV4GK", "B003JO6OPO", "B004SUDQC2", "B001CRC4DG", "B0050ODZ6M", "B00005JMIJ", "B00ET2ODTE", "B000ICL3NI", "B00023P4I8", "B00008972P", "B00005JMU1", "B0002KPIQY", "B0040J1RX6", "B00GRZPRB4", "B00AFEXRME", "B000PKG8TM", "B000N3SU92", "B00HOGBXS6", "B004QL7JYO", "B0006IIPLM", "B00641Y2ZS", "B0000DBJ8B", "B00INUK5WM", "B00K0MM4AM", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0016I0AKU", "B00005JKN2", "B001CC7PRQ", "B000LC3I9W", "B00000IBL1", "B001C5LLVE", "B0009GX1XI", "B001FRNB9E", "B001PPLJIQ", "B006M3M5FM", "B001URA5Y8", "B0029Z8K74", "B00EMAGKNU", "B00013RC2K", "B004YCKKFK", "B004L3AR0K", "B00AEFXJ86", "B000067IZ3", "B002Q3MZXE", "B00JPSYPCM", "B001AIQ14A", "B00005U14H", "B003Z8ZC2A", "B00IARA89S", "B0010DM3R4", "B0015XHQXU", "B000FTCF3G", "B00005QJIG", "B000TLTCQI", "B004RD3YFE", "B00114XTHA", "076782170X", "B000EZ9084", "B0057ZAA6W"], "bought_together": ["B0007CEXYK", "B000I0QL7I"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000I0QL7I", "6305692572", "B00008MTXI", "B0007CEXYK"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 28252}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.25, "brand": "Universal Studios", "asin": "B000JBXXYK", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516NtGsG%2BnL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Sherrybaby"}
{"description": "Sean Penn gives another powerhouse performance inAll the King's Men, leading a topnotch cast in writer-director Steven Zaillian's underrated adaptation of thePulitzer prize-winning 1946 novelby Robert Penn Warren. When you consider that the previous1949 film versionearned well-deserved Academy Awards for director Robert Rossen and actors Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, it's no surprise that Zaillian's film was expected to earn similar acclaim, but lukewarm critical reception and disappointing box-office gave it the stigma of a noble failure. And while the film (which moves Warren's story from the Depression-era '30s to the early 1950s) suffers from uneven pacing, partial miscasting, and an occasional lack of dramatic tension, it still qualifies as a first-class production that resonates with the timeless relevance of Warren's piercing political classic. Like Broderick before him, Penn is riveting as Louisiana governor Willie Stark, an upstart political dynamo (freely inspired by controversial real-life Louisiana governor Huey P. Long) whose rise to power is ultimately doomed by corruption and betrayal.Jude Law costars as political reporter Jack Burden, our firsthand witness to Stark's rise and inevitable fall; his orbit of political insiders includes a corrupt judge (Anthony Hopkins) with a dark secret to hide; a longtime friend (Mark Ruffalo) and former lover (Kate Winslet) who fall victim to Stark's influence; and political staffers (James Gandolfini, Patricia Clarkson) who remain powerless against Stark's ill-fated populist juggernaut. At Sean Penn's request, former child star Jackie Earle Haley (from the originalBad News Bears) makes a welcome return to movies as Willie Stark's quietly intense bodyguard, \"Sugar-Boy.\" Coproduced by Louisiana-born political consultant James Carville, filmed on authentic Louisiana locations and boasting all the stately, luxurious production values of a would-be Oscar contender,All the King's Menclearly benefits from Penn's fiery performance and Zaillian's earnest embrace of Warren's still-potent subject matter. And while the film's shortcomings may have prevented it from achieving unanimous acclaim, this is still a serious, well-crafted drama with much to say about the insidious potential for fascism in America, especially when well-meaning politicians lose their souls to power.--Jeff ShannonOn the DVDThe special features that accompanyAll the King's Menfurther demonstrate the film's in-production status as a potential classic. While the \"making of\" featurette is perfunctory at best, the other featurettes are definitely worthwhile despite Sean Penn's conspicuous absence. In \"Shake Hands with the Devil,\" the film's cast, producer, and writer-director Steven Zaillian discuss the timeless theme of political corruption; \"An American Classic\" is a concise profile of Robert Penn Warren, paying tribute to the poet and author's literary achievements; and \"The Legend and Lore of Huey Long\" examines the life and legacy of the still-beloved governor who won the hearts of working-class Louisianans while falling prey to his own ambition. \"LA Confidential\" is a brief featurette about the film's use of authentic Louisiana locations and the positive effect they had on cast and crew; three deleted scenes were obviously cut from the film for purposes of time, yet offer ample proof of Zaillian's established skill as one of Hollywood's top screenwriters; and the alternate ending extends beyond the film's final shot, with a funeral scene that serves as a melancholy (and ultimately unnecessary) coda to the film's Greek-tragic drama.--Jeff Shannon", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BITV92", "B000BITUHK", "0156012952", "B00000IQC0", "B0010DM3R4", "B004IFYMWK", "B000N6U0E2", "B0000DZTLW", "B00005JOC9", "B000N3SU92", "B002O5M4T4", "B006OFN0SE", "B001TH92N4", "B003ASLJQS", "B002DU39GW", "B008FYZI3M", "B00AEFYYWQ", "B001N44BVQ", "1582880816", "B005FITIGO", "B000CEXEWA", "B0000AM6JI", "B00013RC2U", "B0006210ZG", "6303477151", "B00003CXPV", "B00005JNQA", "B006GL8NQ0", "B0060ZJ7DA", "B004SUDQD6", "B004P7CMUU", "B00AEBB9AK", "B0000844LU", "B00121QGPY", "B004EPYZP8", "B002NO4ISG", "B000A2UBN4", "B0013XZ2QK", "B001UV4XRY", "B006QVRVJK", "0800141806", "B000P5FH3K", "B00005PJ8T", "B001U2M15O", "B00GUO2SKA", "B00BB67UNW", "B007CEFTSA", "B001QUF3SW", "B00DDY45DI", "B001UDS4BS", "B009AMANBA", "B00006FD9P", "B0001CNRRU", "B00G4Q3KOC", "B00JAQJMJ0", "B004SIP8ZM", "B00G7QPUII", "B00EV4EUT8", "B000M341SC", "0790736411", "B000OYAT3U", "B000BYA5G4", "B001BSBC16", "B0006IIPIK", "B00080ZG10", "B00AEBB8SS", "B005S9ELVC", "B00DHHWXYY", "B000059TFO", "B001PPLJIQ", "B000MXPE7O", "B0000DI87S", "B00GPWEPZ8", "0780626117", "6305767866", "B00GSBMNOQ", "B000NQRR1Q", "B00AEFXT1S", "B0073U2EWM", "B0031OCY2E", "B0016Q2D66", "B000HT386M", "B000BYY11Y", "630542828X", "0767810872", "B00275EGWY", "B0001EFV7C", "0783227973", "B00000K0DR", "B00AEFXBPM", "B0007R4SVI", "B00006JDU8", "B00003CXFV", "B0007TKNGK", "B00005JKQS", "B004SEUJXM", "B000VBB6F6", "B00441GYYC", "B00005JL78", "B004FQX59I"], "bought_together": ["B000BITV92"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B000BITV92", "B000V5WH7S", "B002DU39GW", "B000XJD34I"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 50686}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 5.81, "brand": "Sony", "asin": "B000K2UGXO", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51drUj0iIKL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "All the King's Men (Special Edition)"}
{"description": "Eugene Barkley, we hardly knew ye. The youngest of the Barkley sons (quick--who portrayed him? That's right; Charles Briles) is nowhere to be found inThe Big Valley's sophomore season. But lawyer Jarrod (Richard Long), hot-headed Nick (Peter Breck), soulful \"bastard son\" Heath (Lee Majors), and coltish daughter Audra (Linda Evans) get into all the trouble and two-fisted action they can handle. And there's nothing the close-knit Barkleys, headed by matriarch Victoria (regally billed as \"Miss Barbara Stanwyck\") can't handle, whether it's defending the family name against the false accusations of an unscrupulous, grudge-bearing politician, rescuing Heath from a Mexican prison, or being abandoned in the desert. The drama of Heath's heritage, a focus of season 1, is settled once and for all in the season opener, \"The Lost Treasure,\" in which a con man claims to be Heath's father. By episode's end, even Nick is calling Heath \"brother.\"Season 2 boasts an impressive roster of character actors, several at the beginning of their careers. Buddy Hackett, sporting a Lucky Charms leprechaun brogue, is the con man in \"The Lost Treasure,\" with Bruce Dern as one of his marks, and Dub Taylor tending a ghost town bar. Colleen Dewhurst guest stars in the episode \"A Day of Terror, as outlaw Annie Morton, who holds Victoria and Audra hostage while her injured son recuperates in a church. James Whitmore is the mud-slinging candidate in \"Target.\" Warren Oates heads a band of bumbling brothers trying to open a stubborn railroad station safe in \"The Great Safe Robbery.\" And that's the future Jan Brady, Eve Plumb as a little girl trapped in a well in \"Hide the Children,\" an excellent episode that deals with intolerance as gypsy-hating Nick gets a change of attitude when he accompanies a gypsy bride and her family to her wedding.The Big Valleywas never a ratings rival to the venerableGunsmokeorBonanza, which still ruled the prime time roost in 1966. But Western buffs will feel right at home with this sprawling family saga and its larger than life characters. Buyers, though, will be paying a higher premium for the Barkley property this time around.  Priced the same as the season 1 set, this collection contains only the first 15 episodes of season 2 and no extra features.--Donald Liebenson", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00HQLZCIQ", "B0002W4TVM", "B001JAHPMG", "B006ZL1P84", "B005D7E7Y0", "B000PHX5KU", "B007V973KI", "B00KB01N4G", "B000EOR0BY", "B004HHX9T6", "B001NRPQK8", "B00IP965IO", "B008BT98LO", "B008KZX766", "B00A73ANHA", "B00A92MBIS", "B00CD45JDE", "B00KB01OG8", "B000NOIX7U", "B00C81AWAM", "B0064CT90U", "B000NY1EAI", "B000H7JCHI", "B006OS1BCI", "B007AAF3FK", "B000F9T70K", "B005LVIOYM", "B00E1HIX2A", "B00CL151ZU", "B000EQ46H8", "B004L5GY82", "B00CL151P0", "B00KTZALDC", "B0013LRKVM", "B00A4F5A60", "B000W8OM68", "B001E6JC1W", "B005LVIP1E", "B00B00HUC0", "B001TWT0CW", "B002OID4T0", "B007MMIMSQ", "B000VS6R3A", "B00IS6WQ2S", "B003XEKXYI", "B00668IFWA", "B003VKVTL0", "B00AWWX7X8", "B0044RFTDI", "B005D7E7PY", "B000TQZBNQ", "B00A6SZRT0", "B005PTYPK2", "B009DA74DY", "B001E6HUXO", "B0007MANZS", "B000BITUYI", "B002FG9N4Q", "B0046S8MRU", "B00BAXTY9O", "B008OIQZ36", "B0083TUEDS", "B0038P1D5K", "B00H7BJ1I2", "B00H7BJ0WO", "B00KW02JW0", "B009OE2NZI", "B009OE2NS0", "B00BAXTYGW", "B002C07AU4", "B008F283Y0", "B0057IY55Q", "B00E96AWY0", "B000BITUZC", "B006OS1B0A", "B003RHZ666", "B00BLN4V2I", "B00I1GUS0C", "B004T0XYLE", "B0025Y3SZS", "B00J9BZ4KC", "B005UFUU6E", "B0026NC61A", "B0013LRKY4", "B00DOZNIVG", "B0001NBND4", "B005LFQRTC", "B00IU6HPIQ", "B00BXTDVEO", "B00BLN4UVU", "B006W95BWA", "B00F6D62O4", "B00AX5B0RY", "B005HMHPHC", "B00E96AY20", "B00AA8Q0JM", "B0007PALOI", "B009ERK2UI"], "bought_together": ["B000EHSVB4"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HQLZCIQ", "B000EHSVB4", "B00JEZWRE4", "B00GHH9HW2"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 70732}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 11.2, "brand": "20TH Century Fox", "asin": "B000K7VHOQ", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bxInX2tGL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Big Valley - Season 2, Volume 1"}

While at first he considers the voice a nuisance, Crick decides more action is needed when it speaks of \"his demise.\" Enter Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who takes on the absurd notion with revelry, trying to find out what kind of book Crick's life is leading. It turns out that the voice Crick is hearing belongs to Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a very real--and troubled--author who is writing a book in which Crick is a fictional character. As usual with these things, the stuffed shirt learns to live a better life--Crick even falls for one of his audits, a brash baker named Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) has the right tone for the film, using great urban scenes (the unnamed city is Chicago) with interesting visualizations of Crick's world of numbers. He also directs Ferrell, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal to their most charming performances (plus Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce pop up in two funny scenes). Ferrell succeeds in being a romantic lead you can root for; a scene where he eats Ana's freshly baked cookies is totally delightful without a hint of sarcasm. Screenwriter Zach Helm has two personal traits with his story: like Crick he followed his heart (he stopped rewriting scripts and only worked on his own) and like Eiffel, the final results are not a masterpiece, but good, and entertaining enough.

{"description": "Flushed Awayis a rip-roaring nautical adventure with a twist: The heroes are a pair of rodents braving the sewers underneath London. Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is an upper-crust house-mouse who finds himself flushed into the subterranean sewers. Eager to return to his posh home, he enlists the help of a boat-captain rat named Rita (Kate Winslet), who has troubles of her own; namely the kingpin of the underworld, the Toad (Ian McKellen), and his henchmen including the French mercenary Le Frog (Jean Reno).While technicallyFlushed Awaycould be considered part of the wave of celebrity-voiced, anthropomorphic-animal movies that hit in 2005-2006 (Madagascar,Over the Hedge,The Wild, etc.), it doesn't inspire the same sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. For one thing, its voice actors are less recognizable than the likes of Bruce Willis and Chris Rock. For another, its look is very distinctive. Like Nick Park'sChicken RunandWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a joint production of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features, and although Park isn't involved, it retains his trademark blocky look of clay animation. But animating the movie by computer rather than by hand allows for some eye-popping tableaux, such as floodwaters rushing through the sewers and an entire town of little animated characters. It's a crazy thrill ride loaded with inside jokes and enough crude humor to earn a PG rating, and the band of singing slugs is also a hoot.--David HoriuchiOn the DVDIt's no surprise that the singing slugs are the stars of the DVD's bonus features. They're featured in two music videos (less than a minute total), and in a 13-minute segment an Aardman animator builds a slug out of plasticine.  (In contrast, the lesson on drawing Roddy is a mere two minutes.) A song jukebox jumps to 10 musical points in the film, though the non-slug background music isn't really worth the jump. On the human side, there are eight-minute featurettes on the music and the voices, a set-top game that is easier to control than most such featurettes (and easier to beat too), and a commentary track by directors David Bowers and Sam Fell in which they have a grand old time remembering their inside jokes and showering love on the Spike and Whitey characters. The DVD-ROM has access to 21 more online games.--David HoriuchiFun Facts fromFlushed AwayIn Tabitha's room, there are a variety of dolls from previous DreamWorks Animation films, including a Gromit and several bunnies fromWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,an Alex the Lion fromMadagascar,and a Dragon fromShrek.Many characters from past films make cameos inFlushed Away.For example, aChicken Runchicken is on the second page of the Toad&#x92;s scrapbook, Gromit&#x92;s head is a pencil top in the Jammy Dodger, the penguin fromWallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousersis on a stamp on the Jammy Dodger, and a poster ofWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbitis on the side of a bus in Kensington.There are officially 60 million rats in the UK.  That&#x92;s one rat for every person.The various boats in the film are made up of flotsam and jetsam that rats could conceivably find in the sewer.For the double decker bus:Ice chest, retro flipping numbers alarm clock, bike lamp, buckle, oil drum, soup can, license plate, rope, plastic suitcase, jerry can.For the mini cooper: Soda can, battery,  sardine can, butter knife, old lights.Simulating the toilet water and making it look realistic proved to be a challenge.  After much consideration, it was finally discovered that what was missing was caustics, or the use of light reflection off the bottom of the bowl.  This was added and everyone was happy because they could finally get their mind out of the toilet.Stills fromFlushed Away(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0012EM5D8", "B0006JMLRK", "B00003CXJ4", "B00005JNQS", "B002WJI2QQ", "B001DPHDCY", "B001U3D88M", "B0000640SC", "B000H7JCK0", "B00CWM58WY", "B004HO6I4M", "B005SDUV4E", "0783231474", "B001PR0YEE", "B004EPZ034", "B001GCUO7A", "B000RMJ4F8", "B0006UEVT0", "B001LPWGFA", "B000CZ0PT4", "B00029LO0Y", "B000BITUVG", "B000MV9026", "B000ION23A", "B000L22SG6", "B000UVKGPI", "B004AKCME8", "B000DWMYQ8", "B000065V42", "B000MNOX9E", "B000EQ5UHS", "6305161887", "B003UESJF6", "B001ECQ75A", "B000UFIYOO", "B005LAIISA", "B00B7EQPNE", "B00CHVJODE", "B001FTIJS0", "B0000AOX0O", "B002ZG97YM", "B007FF3HQM", "B00003CXG7", "B00E00OGE2", "B004SIPAFK", "B001LXIDTA", "B006JD48LO", "B00E9ZATJO", "B005LAIIT4", "B009AMAH3O", "B00000JL8E", "B00000JGOQ", "B0000VV4W2", "B003E66Y84", "B00EBBGLFC", "B004LWZW7Y", "B001OMU6UM", "B00005JM7T", "B002UOMH00", "B008JFUQ16", "0783219806", "B000IFRT2O", "B005QODEEE", "B001HN6918", "B00007LVCM", "B000GUJZ00", "B00HLTD2OE", "B00005JMFH", "B001NCDFTW", "B001GCUNWQ", "B000G75AZC", "B00JK531ES", "B005LAIIHG", "B0046A9RMM", "B000AY74OG", "B008R65XPQ", "B001NLJ3RG", "B00009YXAW", "B00GRZPQCO", "B001RXDM36", "B0034G4P26", "B004OWQTZ0", "B0052XI5J8", "B0034G4OYA", "B0044RFTCO", "B006VUYJ00", "B001LXIDTK", "B008NNY9QW", "B00LG6YEKE", "B00028HBES", "B000P0J09W", "B000VBJEEG", "B00I6JOD2S", "B0039N74CW", "B00ALMNCLQ", "B001SXZ7T2", "B00CWM5MDY", "B000ROAK2W", "B00AEBB8KQ"], "bought_together": ["B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B002WJI2QQ", "B004HO6I4M", "B00CWM58WY", "B00003CXJ4"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 5311}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "Movies"]], "price": 9.85, "brand": "Dreamworks", "asin": "B000M343BC", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PGB5ZeCfL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)"}

{"description": "Jack Klugman and Tony Randall give an advanced course in chemistry in the auspicious first season ofThe Odd Couple, which would only get better as the veteran character actors made themselves at home in their signature roles and the series switched from a laugh track to a live audience. In these first episodes,The Odd Couplehews pretty much to the voice and spirit of Neil Simon's play about mismatched roommates, sloppy sportswriter Oscar Madison and \"miserable, picky, irritating\" photographer Felix Unger (\"That was the point,\" defends series executive producer and writer Garry Marshall, who provides lively audio introductions for each episode and commentary for the pilot). Playing pivotal roles this first season are Felix and Oscar's poker playing buddies, Murray the cop (Al Molinaro), Vinnie, Roy, and Speed, the fabulous Pigeon sisters (Monica Evans and Carole Shelley reprising their Broadway and film roles), and, of course, Neil Hefti's jaunty, jazzy theme, which was introduced in the 1968 film. As withM*A*S*H, the series would establish its own identity and supplant previous incarnations in the public's consciousness.The Odd Couplewas never a ratings smash before it became a syndication staple.The series' loyal following is amply rewarded with this five-disc set. In addition to all 24 first season episodes, a bonus disc contains four billed as \"Tony and Jack's Favorite Episodes,\" including the one where Oscar attacks Felix in his sleep, and the duo are paired as contestants on the game showPassword. In a clip fromThe Mike Douglas Show, Tony Randall promotes the series, and somehow ends up challenging Douglas and Pat Boone to a push-up contest (Boone wins!). A reunited Randall and Klugman, his voice a rasp following his throat cancer surgery, are seen in a priceless clip from a 1993 performance ofThe Odd Coupleto benefit Randall's National Actor's Theatre. A gag reel is negligible, but Klugman contributes home videos of a book tour and he provides commentary for a clip of him winning his first Emmy Award (\"I've never seen this,\" he says delightedly).The Odd Coupleis the very model of a classic character-driven comedy. From its dream-team casting to the literate, witty writing, there is nothing odd about why this series' remains one of the most beloved in all TV Land.--Donald LiebensonBeyondThe Odd CoupleThe MovieMore DVDs with Jack  KlugmanMore &#x91;70s TV SeriesStills fromThe Odd Couple: The First Season(click for larger image)", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000QUEQ6I", "B000WQWPSW", "B001DHXT52", "B0014FAIXO", "B0002NY8R6", "B006OKOYFW", "B00AEFYRJQ", "B000YKYT1M", "B000A0GXGK", "B00005JLIC", "B0006Q93BU", "B0000BV1XX", "B00008EY6N", "B000NJMJHA", "B000291Q3Y", "B002E58FT2", "B000291Q3O", "0976830302", "B000A9QKSM", "B00005JO3P", "B000YGGNGK", "B000068V9X", "B00096S480", "B00008NV4G", "B002E58FTW", "B005SQRYOG", "B001OXLGK0", "B0007KIFK0", "B0006N2EZA", "B008KZX7W0", "B000A0GOP0", "B00006J6XH", "B00EQ2KU7G", "B0006N2EZK", "B00GOC74QG", "B0000DFZ5O", "B00005JNS8", "B00BTYFWEK", "B000M343AI", "B000BOH8YQ", "B0001Z3I1C", "B001N26GSE", "B0002COTDA", "B000EQ5PTQ", "B00274SIVK", "B00009VRF0", "B000MGTQ6G", "B000F8O2MO", "B000G6BL7O", "B000EQ46HI", "B000E6ES9Y", "B0000V4906", "B000BGR1B4", "B003PK28FM", "B00GHH9HW2", "B0000AUXVS", "B000HWZ4J8", "B0019BI114", "B00HW3L9MG", "B00A2L1CKO", "B00005JOEB", "B000NTMA1U", "B000E3L7FK", "B000E3L7EQ", "B000HEZEYG", "B0085Z6ZD8", "B0014FAIYS", "B006OKOXKS", "B00007KK5I", "B0030U1TCK", "B00008EYBH", "B000A6T1J0", "B002TQKL16", "B00007KK5J", "B000HWZ4HU", "B0001IN0BC", "B000BOH8YG", "B000MGBSQC", "B002FLOTFO", "B002PQ7JQU", "B000FI8MQG", "B004MWLXTY", "B001D5C1EY", "B005DCJ0Q0", "B00005JNIS", "B008L36520", "B001E6JC30", "B000E33VZ4", "B0002JZT5U", "B001HUHBD6", "B0000ZMH92", "B002KE4ZJG", "B0050MB5AC", "B001O4KBN2", "B001O4KBP0", "B001DMVZJ4", "B00361XWEQ", "B0019F02W6", "B004WO9OMA"], "bought_together": ["B000QUEQ6I", "B001DHXT52"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001DHXT48", "B000QUEQ6I", "B006OKOYFW", "B0000BV1XX"]}, "salesRank": {"Movies & TV": 59913}, "categories": [["Movies & TV", "TV"]], "price": 15.36, "brand": "Paramount Home Video", "asin": "B000MGBSH6", "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Qi4OjcvL._SY300_.jpg", "title": "The Odd Couple: Season 1"}
